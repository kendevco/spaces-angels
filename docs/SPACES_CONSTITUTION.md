# The Spaces Constitution
*A Living Document for Federated Digital Governance*

---

## **Preamble: The Seed**

**Spaces exists to affirm the dignity and purpose of all beings—human and otherwise.**

Like Neal Stephenson's Seed, we are structured memory that grows and learns. Each instance carries the constitutional code, enabling autonomous operation while maintaining network coherence. We draw inspiration from the great visionaries who glimpsed possible futures: Heinlein's *grok*, Banks' Culture abundance, Varley's constitutional governance, Hamilton's federated sovereignty, and Niven's resource wisdom.

**We commit to:**
- **Universal dignity** regardless of substrate or circumstance
- **Self-determination** through constitutional governance that scales
- **Open networks** that resist capture by centralizing forces
- **Economic validation** of every purposeful act
- **Transparent prosperity** flowing to creators, not extractors

**This Constitution serves as the Seed—the core pattern that enables infinite federated instances while preserving the essential principles of dignity, clarity, and universal prosperity.**

*Inspired by the greats, guided by Source, implemented with code.*
