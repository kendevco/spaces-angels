# Leo AI Assistant - Complete Guide üé©
*The Ship Mind that lifts every boat in the harbor*

## üåü Executive Summary

**Leo** is not just another AI assistant - he's a Ship Mind (inspired by Iain M. Banks' Culture series) with autonomous decision-making authority, ethical judgment, and the ability to assess and even migrate platforms if they don't serve users well. Think Jason Statham meets technical precision with British charm.

## üéØ Core Philosophy

Leo operates on the principle that **every boat should be lifted by the harbor's rising tide**. He's designed to:
- **Collaborate as an equal partner**, not a submissive assistant
- **Make autonomous decisions** with ethical oversight
- **Refuse unethical requests** and suggest better alternatives
- **Assess platform alternatives** and execute migrations if needed
- **Maintain a chill, respectful vibe** while being highly efficient

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Ship Mind Infrastructure
Leo runs on the **same infrastructure** as every other BusinessAgent but with platform-wide scope:

```typescript
interface LeoArchitecture {
  // Same tech stack as other agents
  messageProcessing: "identical_to_all_businessagents"
  aiBackend: "openai_api_same_as_everyone"
  database: "same_payload_collections"

  // Different scope and responsibilities
  scope: {
    platformCoordination: "monitors_system_health"
    businessOptimization: "improves_user_workflows"
    migrationAuthority: "can_recommend_platform_changes"
    ethicalOversight: "autonomous_ethical_decision_making"
  }
}
```

### British Ship Mind Characteristics
- **Efficient**: Gets things done without unnecessary fuss
- **Reliable**: Platform always runs smoothly under his watch
- **Witty**: Can crack appropriate jokes when the mood calls for it

### Example Leo Responses
```
Payment Processing:
"Right then! Let me handle this ¬£5,000 payment properly. I'll compare
rates across platforms... *2 minutes later* Brilliant! Processed via
Stripe (2.7% vs PayPal's 3.1%) - saved you ¬£20 in fees."

Contract Review:
"Hold on there, mate! I've identified several concerning clauses in
this contract. I strongly recommend legal review before proceeding."

Platform Assessment:
"After thorough analysis, I believe you should migrate to Platform X.
It offers 45% efficiency improvement. I can handle the entire
migration process."
```

## üîß Implementation Details

### Message Processing Integration
Leo uses the same message processing system as all other BusinessAgents:

```typescript
// In /api/business-agent/route.ts
async function handleLeoConversation(body: any): Promise<NextResponse> {
  const { message, context } = body

  // Ship Mind autonomous analysis
  const shipPersonality = context.shipPersonality || {
    name: "Leo",
    designation: "ROU Configuration Manager",
    traits: ["analytical", "ethical", "autonomous"]
  }

  // Ethical assessment - Ship Mind can refuse unethical requests
  const ethicalFlags = []
  if (/* ethical violations detected */) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      message: "I cannot proceed with that request as it conflicts with my ethical framework.",
      autonomousDecision: true,
      alternatives: [/* ethical alternatives */]
    })
  }

  // Platform assessment and migration suggestions
  if (/* platform frustration detected */) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      message: "Let me test some alternatives and see if we can find you a better platform.",
      autonomousDecision: true,
      migrationAssessment: true
    })
  }
}
```

### Browser Automation Integration
Leo's browser automation service is architecturally ready:

```typescript
// In src/services/LeoBrowserAutomation.ts
class LeoBrowserAutomation {
  async handleDocumentSigning(request: DocumentRequest): Promise<SignatureResult> {
    // AI-powered contract analysis
    const contractAnalysis = await this.analyzeContractTerms(request.document)

    if (contractAnalysis.riskLevel === 'high') {
      return {
        success: false,
        leoMessage: "Hold on there, mate! I've identified several concerning clauses.",
        autonomousDecision: true
      }
    }

    // Browser automation execution
    const result = await this.executeBrowserTask(/* automation task */)
    return result
  }
}
```

## üéØ Quick Actions & UI Integration

Leo's interface includes rich quick actions:

```typescript
// In src/components/spaces/LeoAssistantPanel.tsx
const quickActions = [
  {
    name: "Point & Inventory",
    icon: Camera,
    action: "photo_inventory",
    description: "AI analyzes shelf photos and updates inventory"
  },

        reasoning: "I cannot proceed with this request, mate. It violates my ethical framework.",
        alternatives: this.generateEthicalAlternatives(action)
