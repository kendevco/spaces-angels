# Implementation Priorities: Universal AI Infrastructure

*Building the platform layer that doesn't exist - with zero friction buy-in*

## Mission Statement

**"AIs can come and go - it's the memories they encode that makes them meaningful."**

We're building infrastructure for AI democracy, where success is shared, data dignity is preserved, and migration freedom prevents vendor lock-in. Like a great concierge - friendly, equipped for any task, always optimizing.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Next 30 Days)

### 1. Hey Integration - Social AI Democracy
