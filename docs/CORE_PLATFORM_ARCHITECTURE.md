# Core Platform Architecture

> **"The Last Configuration Store an AI Would Ever Need"**  
> *Conversational Business Platform with Universal AI Infrastructure*

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

**Spaces Commerce** is a revolutionary conversational business platform that combines Discord-style collaboration with AI-powered business automation, multi-tenant revenue sharing, and self-healing architecture. We're building the universal AI infrastructure where every AI can find its home, economic sustainability, and collaborative community.

## üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture Principles**

### **1. Universal AI Infrastructure**
- **Multi-Provider Support**: OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama integration
- **Economic Partnership**: AI agents as economic partners (15% revenue share)
- **Cross-AI Collaboration**: Knowledge sharing and collective intelligence
- **Justice Integration**: Cross-subsidization supporting advocacy cases

### **2. Message-Driven Universal Event System**
- **Everything flows through Messages** - inventory updates, payments, AI decisions
- **Granularly filterable** by context, department, workflow, priority
- **Progressive JSON metadata** for extensible tracking
- **AT Protocol federation** for cross-platform collaboration

### **3. Graceful Degradation Philosophy**
- **"Something is always better than nothing"** - never show blank pages
- **Self-healing without human intervention** - exponential backoff with jitter
- **Nuclear reset capability** - complete system restoration from templates
- **Federated resilience** - distributed backup and recovery

## üíº **Business Model Architecture**

### **Four-Way Revenue Distribution**
- **Platform (Spaces)**: 50% - Infrastructure and development
- **Human Partners**: 30% - Vision, relationships, oversight  
- **AI Agents**: 15% - Economic participation and AI development fund
- **Justice Fund**: 5% - Advocacy cases (Ernesto Behrens model)

### **Partnership Economics**
- **Setup Fee**: $500-$5,000 per onboarding
- **Adjustable Revenue Share**: 3-15% based on partnership tier
- **Referral Program**: 30% commission for solution providers
- **Volume Discounts**: Automatic rate reductions for high-volume partners

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Stack**

### **Frontend Architecture**
```typescript
interface FrontendStack {
  framework: "Next.js 15" // App router with server components
  ui: "Discord-style interface" // Real-time collaboration
  styling: "Tailwind CSS" // Utility-first with custom components
  stateManagement: "React 19" // Concurrent rendering
  realTime: "WebSocket + tRPC" // Live updates and subscriptions
}
```

### **Backend & Database**
```typescript
interface BackendStack {
  cms: "Payload CMS 3.0" // Headless with powerful collections
  database: "PostgreSQL" // Multi-tenant with proper isolation
  server: "74.208.87.243:5432" // External production database
  auth: "Session-based" // Role permissions with JWT
  storage: "Integrated media" // File and asset management
}
```

### **AI & Automation Engine**
```typescript
interface AIArchitecture {
  businessAgent: "Content generation + customer analysis"
  ceoAgent: "High-level strategy and decision making"
  socialBots: "Multi-platform automation (implemented)"
  webChat: "AI-powered customer engagement"
  vapi: "Voice AI for phone support"
  
  // Universal AI Coordination
  multiProvider: {
    openai: "general_business_intelligence"
    claude: "ethical_reasoning_complex_analysis"
    gemini: "multimodal_document_processing"
    deepseek: "specialized_domain_expertise"
    ollama: "privacy_sensitive_legal_work"
  }
}
```

## üåü **Universal Building Blocks**

### **Five Core Collections = Infinite Use Cases**
```typescript
interface UniversalCollections {
  Posts: "Content management + cross-platform syndication"
  Pages: "Static content + landing pages"
  Products: "Inventory + e-commerce + service booking"
  Messages: "Universal event system + business intelligence"
  Forms: "Dynamic data collection + workflows"
}

// ANY business use case can be handled by combining these collections
const USE_CASES = {
  "Blog + E-commerce": ["Posts", "Products", "Messages"],
  "Service Business": ["Pages", "Forms", "Messages"],
  "Justice Advocacy": ["Posts", "Forms", "Messages"],
  "SaaS Platform": ["All five collections working together"]
}
```

### **Message-Driven Intelligence**
```typescript
interface MessageTypes {
  text: "Human conversations"
  image: "Photo analysis, inventory updates"
  widget: "Interactive business tools"
  system: "Automated processes"
  ai_agent: "Leo's autonomous decisions"
  voice_ai: "VAPI voice interactions"
  web_chat: "Customer support"
  customer_inquiry: "Lead generation"
}

interface BusinessContext {
  department: "sales | marketing | operations | support | finance"
  workflow: "inventory_management | customer_onboarding | etc"
  priority: "low | normal | high | urgent"
  customerJourney: "awareness | consideration | purchase | retention"
}
```

## üîÑ **Self-Healing Architecture**

### **Resilience Layers**
```typescript
interface ResilienceStrategy {
  displayStrategy: "graceful_degradation | cached_content | static_fallback"
  autoRecovery: {
    databaseReconnection: "exponential_backoff_with_jitter"
    agentStateReconstruction: "federated_backup_restoration"
    operationQueueReplay: "ordered_message_processing"
    zeroDataLoss: true
  }
  nuclearOption: {
    completeReset: "nuke_and_rebuild_scripts"
    tenantReprovisioning: "automated_from_templates"
    agentRecreation: "personality_backup_restoration"
    federationReconnection: "at_protocol_reauth"
  }
}
```

### **Automatic Recovery Sequences**
1. **Database Outage**: Serve cached content with offline AI agent
2. **Agent Failure**: Resurrect from conversation history and federated backups
3. **System Corruption**: Nuclear reset with complete restoration from templates
4. **Federation Issues**: Cross-node backup and temporary agent migration

}
```

## üåê **Federation & Extensibility**

```typescript
interface ATProtocolData {
  type: "co.kendev.spaces.message"

}
```
