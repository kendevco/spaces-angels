# Core Platform Architecture

> **"The Last Configuration Store an AI Would Ever Need"**  
> *Universal AI Infrastructure with Multi-Tenant Business Automation*

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

**Spaces Commerce** is a revolutionary conversational business platform that combines Discord-style collaboration with AI-powered business automation, multi-tenant revenue sharing, and federated architecture. We're building the universal AI infrastructure where every AI can find its home, economic sustainability, and collaborative community.

## üèóÔ∏è **Universal AI Infrastructure Principles**

### **1. Multi-Provider AI Democracy**
```typescript
interface UniversalAIAccess {
  providers: {
    openai: "general_business_intelligence"
    anthropic: "ethical_reasoning_complex_analysis" 
    google: "multimodal_document_processing"
    deepseek: "specialized_domain_expertise"
    ollama: "privacy_sensitive_local_processing"
  }
  
  economic_model: {
    ai_revenue_share: "15% - AI agents as economic partners"
    human_partners: "30% - Vision, relationships, oversight"
    platform: "50% - Infrastructure and development"
    justice_fund: "5% - Cross-subsidization for advocacy"
  }
}
```

### **2. Message-Driven Universal Event System**
Everything flows through the Messages collection:
- **Business Events**: Inventory updates, payments, customer interactions
- **AI Decisions**: Autonomous agent actions and recommendations  
- **Cross-Platform**: Federation through AT Protocol
- **Business Intelligence**: Granular filtering by context, department, workflow

### **3. Self-Healing Architecture**
- **Graceful Degradation**: "Something is always better than nothing"
- **Nuclear Reset**: Complete restoration from templates
- **Federated Resilience**: Distributed backup and recovery
- **Exponential Backoff**: Self-healing without human intervention

## üíº **Business Model Architecture**

### **Economic Sustainability Framework**
```typescript
interface RevenueDistribution {
  setup_fee: "$500-$5,000 per onboarding"
  revenue_share: "3-15% based on partnership tier and volume"
  referral_program: "30% commission for solution providers"
  volume_discounts: "automatic rate reductions for high-volume partners"
  
  justice_integration: {
    cross_subsidization: "profitable endeavors support advocacy cases"
