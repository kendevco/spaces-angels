# JULES MICRO-TASK 008: Test Queue Foundation
**Priority: HIGH | Estimated: 5-7 minutes | Shih Tzu Size: PERFECT**

---

## 🎯 **WHAT'S ALREADY DONE FOR YOU**

✅ **JobQueue collection** - Created and added to payload.config.ts  
✅ **SimpleQueueService** - Database-based queue service (no Redis needed)  
✅ **API endpoint** - `/api/queue/test` ready for testing  
✅ **All code committed** - Latest version available on GitHub  

---

## 🐕 **YOUR SIMPLE TASK**

**Test the queue system that's already built.** That's it. Nothing complex.

### **Step 1: Start the development server**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### **Step 2: Test adding a job**
```bash
# POST request to add a test job
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/queue/test
```

### **Step 3: Check the admin panel**
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/admin`
2. Navigate to **Job Queue** collection
3. Verify you can see the test job that was created

### **Step 4: Test processing jobs**
```bash
# GET request to process jobs and get stats
curl http://localhost:3000/api/queue/test
```

---

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

**You succeed if:**
- ✅ API endpoint responds without errors
- ✅ Jobs appear in the admin panel
- ✅ Queue stats show correct counts
- ✅ No TypeScript errors

**That's literally it.** No Redis, no BullMQ, no complex setup.

---

## 🚨 **IF SOMETHING DOESN'T WORK**

**Don't spend more than 5 minutes debugging.** Just document:
1. What command you ran
2. What error you got
3. What you expected to happen

Then **stop and report back.** We'll fix it in the next iteration.

---

## 🎯 **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

This micro-task teaches you:
- How the simple queue system works
- How to test API endpoints
- How to verify database collections
- **Most importantly:** How to succeed with small, focused tasks

---

## 📋 **WHAT TO REPORT BACK**

**When you're done (5-7 minutes), report:**
1. **Status:** ✅ Success or ❌ Failed
2. **What worked:** List what went smoothly
3. **What didn't work:** Any errors or issues
4. **Queue stats:** How many jobs pending/completed
5. **Next suggestion:** What should the next micro-task be?

**This is Shih Tzu-sized. You got this! 🐕**

*Remember: Small wins build confidence. This is just testing what's already built.* ✨
