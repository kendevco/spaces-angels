# 009 - Leo Interface Enhancement - Google Mariner Level Conversational Flows

## üéØ Objective
Implement cutting-edge conversational flows for Leo AI that rival Google Mariner's sophistication, enabling dynamic widgets in messages.content and creating an intuitive, context-aware AI assistant experience.

## üìù Context
Leo AI currently has basic chat functionality, but we need to elevate it to Google Mariner's level of sophistication. This means implementing advanced conversational flows, dynamic content rendering, contextual understanding, and seamless integration with the Andrew Martin Control Panel.

### Current State
- Basic Leo AI chat interface exists in `src/components/VAPIChatWidget/`
- Message collection supports JSON content structure
- Ship Mind personality system implemented (Task 001)
- Browser automation capabilities ready (Task 002)
- Missing: Advanced conversational flows and dynamic widget system

### Design Philosophy
Leo should embody the **Ship Mind** philosophy:
- **Autonomous Intelligence** - Proactive assistance and decision-making
- **Contextual Awareness** - Understanding user intent and business context
- **Ethical Reasoning** - Moral assessment integrated into every interaction
- **Guardian Angel Spirit** - Technology that lifts people up

## üîß Technical Requirements

Create a sophisticated conversation management system:

```typescript
interface ConversationFlow {
  flowId: string
  currentState: ConversationState
  context: ConversationContext
  history: ConversationTurn[]
  intentChain: IntentChain
  dynamicWidgets: DynamicWidget[]
  businessContext: BusinessContext
}

interface ConversationState {
  phase: 'greeting' | 'discovery' | 'problem_solving' | 'action_planning' | 'execution' | 'follow_up'
  subState: string
  confidence: number
  nextActions: PossibleAction[]
  userSentiment: SentimentAnalysis
}

interface ConversationContext {
  userId: string

  speaker: 'user' | 'leo'
  content: MessageContent
  intent: DetectedIntent
  widgets: DynamicWidget[]
  actions: CompletedAction[]
  sentiment: SentimentAnalysis
}

interface IntentChain {
  primaryIntent: string
  secondaryIntents: string[]
  intentHistory: string[]
  contextualFactors: string[]
  businessGoals: string[]
}
```

### 2. Dynamic Widget System
Implement rich, interactive widgets within message content:

```typescript
interface DynamicWidget {
  widgetId: string
  type: WidgetType
  content: WidgetContent
  interactionCapabilities: InteractionCapability[]
  businessContext: BusinessContext
  ethicalConstraints: string[]
}

type WidgetType = 
  | 'business_metrics_chart'

  | 'migration_assessment'
  | 'guardian_angel_network'
  | 'ethical_decision_tree'
  | 'action_confirmation'
  | 'progress_tracker'
  | 'recommendation_carousel'

interface WidgetContent {
  data: Record<string, any>
  visualization: VisualizationConfig
  interactions: InteractionConfig
  realTimeUpdates: boolean
  businessIntelligence: BusinessIntelligenceData
}

interface InteractionCapability {
  action: string

}

// Autonomous Decision Making
interface AutonomousDecision {
  decisionId: string
  context: DecisionContext
  reasoning: string[]
  ethicalAssessment: EthicalAssessment
  confidence: number
  humanApprovalRequired: boolean
  alternativeOptions: string[]
}
```

### 4. Integration with Andrew Martin Control Panel
Seamless integration with the master control panel:

```typescript
interface LeoControlPanelIntegration {

  deploymentMonitoring: boolean
  performanceAnalytics: boolean
}

interface BusinessIntelligenceCapabilities {
  revenueAnalytics: boolean
  marketResearch: boolean
  competitiveIntelligence: boolean
  trendAnalysis: boolean
}
```

### 5. Ethical AI Framework Integration
Embed ethical reasoning throughout the conversational experience:

```typescript
interface EthicalConversationFramework {
  ethicalPrinciples: EthicalPrinciple[]
  decisionGuidelines: DecisionGuideline[]
  transparencyRequirements: TransparencyRequirement[]
  humanOversightTriggers: OversightTrigger[]
}

interface EthicalPrinciple {
  name: string
  description: string
  weight: number
  applicationRules: string[]
  violationConsequences: string[]
}

interface DecisionGuideline {
  scenario: string
  guideline: string
  ethicalConsiderations: string[]
  requiredApprovals: string[]
}
```
