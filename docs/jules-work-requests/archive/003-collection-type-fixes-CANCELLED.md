# 003 - Collection Type Fixes (CANCELLED - Out of Sync)

## ❌ Status: CANCELLED
**Cancellation Date**: [Current date]
**Reason**: Task became out of sync with actual codebase state after Tasks 001 & 002 completion

## 🎯 Original Objective
Fix remaining 67+ TypeScript errors in collection files and related type mismatches to achieve zero compilation errors across the entire Angel OS codebase.

## 📋 Why Cancelled
- Tasks 001 & 002 changed the error landscape significantly
- Original error count and file list no longer matched reality
- New Task 003 (Andrew Martin types) and Task 004 (Collection integration) created to address actual current errors

## 🔄 Replacement Tasks
- **Task 003-NEW**: [003-andrew-martin-types.md](../003-andrew-martin-types.md) - Fix Andrew Martin Control Panel types
- **Task 004-NEW**: [004-collection-integration-fixes.md](../004-collection-integration-fixes.md) - Fix remaining service/collection errors

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Task specifications need to be updated when dependencies complete
- Real-time error analysis required for accurate task scoping
- Archival system prevents rework and maintains historical context
