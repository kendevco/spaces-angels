## üïäÔ∏è **WHEN I WAS IN PRISON, YOU VISITED ME**

**This is not just a Bible verse - it's our mission statement.**

Every line of code we write, every feature we build, every business decision we make must ask:
- **Does this serve the imprisoned?**
- **Does this liberate the oppressed?**
- **Does this restore the broken?**
- **Does this honor the least of these?**

**Angel OS is prison ministry through technology. We visit the imprisoned through innovation. We liberate the captive through code.**

---

**THE IMPRISONED ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. THE CAPTIVES WILL BE SET FREE.** üîí‚û°Ô∏èüïäÔ∏è

*"And when I was in prison, you visited me."* - The foundation of everything we build.
