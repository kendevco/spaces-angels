Intro
0:00
so I went down a rabbit hole the other
0:01
night looking for dumb ways that people
0:04
are making money online and I ended up
0:06
finding some stuff that honestly is kind
0:09
of genius Like they shouldn't work They
0:11
sound ridiculous but people are out
0:14
there actually making real money doing
0:16
this stuff Now obviously nothing in this
0:19
video is financial advice I mean these
0:21
are all pretty dumb side hustles but
0:23
they're entertaining They're weirdly
0:25
creative And for some reason they
0:27
actually work for some people So let's
0:29
break down seven of the dumbest ways I
0:32
have ever found to make money online
0:34
that somehow aren't a waste of time So
Naming Babies
0:37
let's start with something that sounds
0:38
way too simple to be real Naming babies
0:42
Well not just babies actually You can
0:44
get paid to name a lot of different
0:45
stuff but babies are definitely the
0:48
weirdest thing on this list that people
0:50
will pay you to name So if you head on
0:52
over to fiverr.com you'll actually see
0:54
people who are selling this as a gig I'm
0:57
going to search in here for baby names
1:00
and you'll see that there are multiple
1:02
people offering this as a service And
1:05
many of them have reviews meaning that
1:07
people are actually buying this as a
1:10
service for them Now this doesn't sound
1:13
like very much like earning $20 every
1:15
time you suggest a baby name But
1:17
honestly for that amount of work it's
1:19
it's really not that bad But if you want
1:21
some more money if that's just not
1:23
enough for you I found this other great
1:25
site called Atom And Atom is where
1:28
businesses can hold these contests to
1:31
help them come up with names or taglines
1:33
for their business So for instance
1:36
recently these were some of the contests
1:38
that were held So we have this one right
1:41
here Someone was looking for a name for
1:43
their tech startup and someone came up
1:45
with the word or the name work hippo And
1:49
the person that came up with the word or
1:50
the the business name work hippo earned
1:53
$300 Not that bad Coming down here we
1:56
see another one like that This person
1:58
was looking for a name for their beauty
2:00
business or cosmetics business and they
2:02
got paid $300 or they paid someone $300
2:05
to come up with this name Blumore Right
2:08
Let's look for one more right here
2:10
because these are kind of fun So we have
2:12
this one right here which is another
2:14
cosmetics business These people paid
2:17
$135 in this contest for the business
2:20
name of Glo
2:23
Glo So really not that bad Um you just
2:27
kind of submit these and you can be one
2:29
of the winners Now what's cool about
2:30
this is that anyone can sign up and
2:33
enter these contests There aren't like
2:34
any credentials that you need You don't
2:36
need like a marketing degree to do this
2:39
So honestly if you're creative and kind
2:41
of witty then you'll probably be able to
2:44
come up with these names pretty easily
2:46
And then believe it or not you can get
2:48
paid for it Now if naming babies and
2:50
businesses seems a little too I don't
2:52
know wholesome for you let's take it up
2:54
a notch and get a little bit weirder Hey
2:57
do you want to be my friend i'll pay you
Rent a Friend
3:00
Yes believe it or not you can literally
3:02
get paid just to be someone's friend
3:05
Sites like Rent a Friend let you charge
3:08
for virtual or in-person hangouts text
3:10
sessions even just to be someone's
3:12
check-in buddy So check this out This is
3:14
the website right here And if you come
3:16
on here you can sign up to either rent a
3:18
friend or be a friend who is rented And
3:22
for instance these are all the friends
3:24
in my local community who are doing this
3:27
as a service And you can see they give
3:29
the person's name their age where
3:31
they're from and a little blurb about
3:33
them so you can understand them better
3:35
and what they might be good for if
3:37
you're looking to rent a friend And here
3:38
on the main page we see some of the
3:40
events or some of the kind of things
3:42
that you can do as a rent a friend You
3:44
can be rented for going to a bar with
3:46
someone being a virtual friend going to
3:49
a club with them going to a party with
3:51
them hiking going to some sort of music
3:53
festival Basically anything that a
3:55
friend would do with you you can do as a
3:58
service And this may seem silly at first
4:01
but there are dozens of reasons why this
4:03
makes a lot of sense So imagine for a
4:06
second that someone is flying into town
4:07
for a wedding or some sort of business
4:10
event and they don't want to show up
4:12
alone So what they can do is they can
4:14
rent you just for that night just to
4:16
hang out with them So they have their
4:18
plus two or plus one I should say and so
4:20
they're not showing up alone Or maybe
4:22
someone is new in town They want to go
4:24
out to a bar and meet people but they
4:26
need like a wingman so they can hire you
4:28
to hang out with them so they don't feel
4:30
alone going out to a bar So if you're a
4:32
very compassionate person if you're like
4:34
a good listener I think this could be a
4:36
great gig for you And you can even do
4:38
all this uh all your hangouts virtually
4:41
In fact I read an article about someone
4:43
who got paid hundreds of dollars in a
4:45
single weekend just for watching Netflix
4:47
with strangers over Zoom Okay so let's
Dropshipping
4:50
go back to the original purpose of this
4:52
video which was to find dumb ways to
4:54
make money online And this next one
4:57
admittedly sounds pretty dumb I'm
4:59
talking about drop shipping Now if
5:01
you're not familiar with how this works
5:03
how drop shipping works this is
5:04
basically it It's very simple to
5:06
understand We have this item for sale
5:08
here on eBay and this person who's
5:11
selling it is a drop shipper I know that
5:14
because the exact same item could be
5:16
found for less money on Walmart And
5:18
that's actually exactly what this seller
5:20
on eBay is going to do If you buy from
5:23
them what they're going to do is they're
5:25
going to turn around and then purchase
5:27
the item for less money from Walmart And
5:29
during the checkout process they are
5:31
going to enter in your shipping address
5:33
That way Walmart ships it directly to
5:36
you hands off for them So that is how
5:38
drop shipping works And this is actually
5:41
pretty easy to do thanks to some
5:42
software This is a software I use to run
5:45
my own drop shipping business It's
5:46
called AutoDS And this actually
5:48
automates most of the drop shipping
5:50
process So for instance if I wanted to
5:52
list an item all I had to do was click
5:55
here where it says add a single product
5:57
paste in the Walmart URL for it and I
5:59
can then have that item live in my eBay
6:02
store it will increase the price so that
6:04
I actually make money on the sale And if
6:07
there's any price changes on Walmart
6:09
later or if the item goes out of stock
6:10
later the the software automates all
6:13
that as well on eBay So really anyone no
6:15
matter how dumb they are can do this But
6:18
I think you can already see the problem
6:21
with this and how dumb this business
6:23
model is because you're literally
6:25
selling an item for $150 or so when
6:29
someone could buy it on Walmart for just
6:32
$109 So why would anyone pay more for it
6:36
well believe it or not they do I was
6:39
actually able to quit my nine-to-five
6:41
job back in 2017 because I was making
6:44
more money from drop shipping than I was
6:46
working as a lawyer And I think the
6:48
reason this works so well is just
6:50
because of convenience People would
6:52
rather shop on one site the site that
6:54
they're familiar with the site that
6:55
they've shopped on before that already
6:57
has their credit card information stored
6:59
in it rather than shop around and try to
7:02
find a better price somewhere else
7:04
Regardless of the reason and whether you
7:06
think it's dumb or not we've seen time
7:08
and time again that it absolutely does
7:11
work I know pretty dumb And if you
7:14
thought that was dumb wait till you hear
7:16
what people are doing with AI voices So
YouTube
7:19
most of us know that you can make a
7:21
decent amount of money with a YouTube
7:23
channel The problem is it takes a lot of
7:25
work I actually spend a lot of time
7:27
coming up with ideas for my videos
7:29
putting together outlines recording them
7:31
editing them the thumbnails like all of
7:33
it it actually takes a lot of time But
7:36
as dumb as it sounds you can actually
7:38
start a YouTube channel without really
7:40
doing anything yourself So look at this
7:43
This is a very popular channel here on
7:45
YouTube They have over 2 million 2.6
7:48
million subscribers And what makes this
7:51
channel stand out to me why I'm bringing
7:53
it to your attention is that all of
7:55
these videos they never show a single
7:58
person's face These are completely
8:01
faceless YouTube channels which really
8:04
means that anyone can be making these
8:07
videos Like when I make my videos on
8:09
YouTube I have to make them because I'm
8:11
always the face of the channel But this
8:13
channel right here that I'm showing you
8:16
really anyone can be making these videos
8:18
They're not just locked into one person
8:20
like my channel is And this isn't unique
8:23
There are other people doing it Here's
8:25
another channel with over 15 million
8:27
subscribers and it's the same thing
8:29
Every single one of these videos are
8:32
completely faceless Now like I said
8:34
before what's so dumb about this is that
8:37
you can literally use AI to do all of
8:41
this for you So I've come over here to
8:44
chat GBT And what you could do first is
8:46
actually ask it hey give me some good
8:47
ideas for faceless YouTube channels But
8:50
I've done that in the past and I know
8:52
that one popular type of faceless
8:54
YouTube channel that does well are these
8:56
horror story channels where the videos
8:58
are basically long narratives long
9:01
stories that are scary with just some
9:04
video over the top of it So what I've
9:06
done here is I've come over to chat GBT
9:08
and I said "Hey write me a script for a
9:10
30 minute YouTube video that is a horror
9:12
ghost story." And here it made one for
9:15
me An entire script that I didn't need
9:18
to write myself And this took me seconds
9:21
to make Then once you have the script
9:24
you can plug it into 11 Labs which is
9:27
basically an AI voice generator that can
9:29
turn written text into like this ultra
9:32
realistic speech It's what a lot of
9:35
these faceless YouTube channels end up
9:37
using for their videos so that they
9:40
sound human without anyone actually
9:42
having to record themselves So for
9:45
instance let's come back over here to
9:46
Chat GPT and I will go ahead and grab
9:49
this I'll just copy this and we'll paste
9:52
it in here and let's see what it sounds
9:54
like Some stories are just stories until
9:57
they happen to you This isn't a legend
9:59
It's not something I read on Reddit This
10:01
is what happened to me in the fall of
10:04
2016 I mean that's pretty good And
10:08
that's what a lot of these channels are
10:09
using Then once you have the voice over
10:12
you can use stock footage from websites
10:13
like Canva to put together an entire
10:16
YouTube video and you never even had to
10:18
show your face So as dumb as that sounds
10:21
it actually works And because you're not
10:24
actually involved in the process or
10:26
don't have to be you can actually
10:27
outsource eventually the entire thing
ASMR
10:30
But if that doesn't sound very
10:31
satisfying to you maybe this next one
10:34
will be a little more
10:36
satisfying So imagine for a second that
10:39
you can make money just by whispering
10:42
into a mic chewing into a mic or even
10:46
just
10:47
tapping Really that sounds pretty dumb
10:50
but it's true Seriously this is one I
10:53
don't get but it is seriously wildly
10:56
successful There are these ASMR channels
10:58
that do exactly that They just make
11:00
these noises into the microphone They
11:02
whisper into it They tap on it They do
11:05
stuff like I know what is she doing here
11:06
like grabbing these cups and like
11:08
clinking them together or unrolling tape
11:11
or I guess breaking apart chocolate And
11:15
the sound for some people is extremely
11:17
satisfying So these people will watch
11:19
these really or listen to these
11:21
extremely long videos like this one's 42
11:25
minutes this one 30 minutes and they
11:27
rack up hundreds of thousands of views
11:29
So it's a very easy way to get really
11:32
really really long watch time on YouTube
11:35
which is the way that you make a lot of
11:37
money on YouTube And of course these
11:38
ASMR videos are pretty easy to make You
11:41
just need a really good microphone and
11:43
and that's really it And there actually
11:44
a lot of channels that where people
11:46
don't even show their face So if you got
11:48
like a quiet room a halfway decent mic
11:51
this might be the way to make some money
11:52
on YouTube as dumb as it sounds Now
11:55
speaking of things that are dumb I have
11:57
to admit something to you I am really
11:59
bad at these capture things Like very
12:02
bad at them I never know where to click
12:04
A lot of them I just cannot solve at all
12:07
I'm like is that a picture of a
12:08
horseshoe or is it something else i I
12:11
don't know Honestly I'm so dumb when it
12:13
comes to these captions I'd be willing
12:15
to pay someone to do them for me And
12:17
actually that person could be you There
12:20
is this website that actually pays you
12:22
to solve these captions It is completely
12:25
free to use You can do it right from
12:27
your phone and you can receive instant
12:30
payments for using this website So the
12:33
website is
12:35
tocaptia.com Now admittedly you don't
12:37
get paid a lot to do this but if you
12:39
have nothing else to do is an easy way
12:41
to make some money Unless of course
12:42
you're me then it's actually really hard
12:45
way to make money And the final dumb way
Free Furniture
12:48
to make money online that I want to
12:50
share with you today is admittedly not
12:52
one that's entirely online but at least
12:55
part of it is So if you come over here
12:57
to Facebook Marketplace and you just
12:58
search for free you're going to see a
13:00
lot of people giving away a lot of stuff
13:02
You'll see a lot of furniture like
13:04
bookshelves You see a lot of baby and
13:06
kids stuff small appliances electronics
13:09
All you have to do is pick these items
13:10
up and they're yours completely free Now
13:13
what you can then do is clean them up
13:16
fix them up and then resell them later
13:19
Like 30 bucks just like a low price and
13:21
a lot of people you can actually sell
13:23
these products So for instance this one
13:25
right here this is a mid-century modern
13:28
accent chair and it's in really good
13:30
shape and they are giving away for free
13:32
They were trying to get some money for
13:33
it but now they are going to give it
13:35
away for free Now this sounds dumb right
13:38
why would anyone give away stuff that
13:40
they could just sell or why would
13:42
someone buy something when you got it
13:45
for free but in truth there are a few
13:48
reasons this works First some people are
13:50
just in a rush to get rid of stuff Maybe
13:51
they're moving or something or they just
13:53
need some extra space Other people are
13:56
lazy and don't want to clean up their
13:57
items or take nice photos And other
14:00
people they really just don't know how
14:02
to sell stuff on Facebook Marketplace
14:04
And there are actually a ton of people
14:06
who do this with huge success You can
14:09
come on YouTube and just search for free
14:11
uh flipping free furniture and see a lot
14:14
of people who are doing this So as dumb
14:16
as it sounds this actually works So yeah
14:19
those are seven of the dumbest ways I
14:22
have ever found to make money online
14:24
that somehow actually work Some of them
14:26
are clever some of them are weird most
14:29
of them are just dumb but they all prove
14:31
one thing There are countless ways to
14:33
make money online And in fact I'm always
14:35
exploring new ideas on this channel So
14:37
if you want to see all my future side
14:39
hustle ideas make sure to subscribe to
14:41
my channel Then let me know in the
14:43
comment section which one of these seven
14:44
ideas you liked the best Otherwise
14:47
thanks so much for watching and I'll see
14:48
you in the next video Bye for now

Manis AI it's a tool so powerful that the US wants to ban it now in this video
0:06
I'm going to demo Manis Ai and if you have not heard about it yet you're going to be shocked because it is the latest
0:12
in AI Tech and again it's called Manis which is essentially a general AI agent this is not just a tool like chat gbt
0:20
that you ask questions to it gives you answers sure but it also actually goes out and takes action for you and
0:27
remember in this series we've been asking AI tools like deep and Manis AI how to make money online
0:33
and verifying if these techniques techniques actually work so in today's video I've asked Manis AI to help me
0:40
make $1,000 online and I was shocked because it instructed me to do some things that I'm already doing which I
0:47
know for sure work to make money so that gave me some confidence to keep doing what I'm doing but only better and it
0:54
actually helped make those tactics better so for those of you that have
0:59
heard of ai4 before but are on the wait list to get access or have maybe paid
1:04
thousands of dollars in this video I'm going to show you how I've gained free access and taught probably a dozen others to get free access as well
1:10
there's a probably a very high probability that this video is going to get taken down because they don't want
1:15
me talking about this so be sure to help me push this out there by liking this video subscribing to the channel and
1:21
sharing it with a friend now unlike most YouTubers I'm not selling you anything in this video I'm actually giving you
1:26
something for free plus all of this information so I've put put together a Google doc of resources that I've used
1:32
in this video which I've included in the Vault of my four-part AI FastTrack training where we go deeper on making
1:39
money with AI and I'm going to give you absolutely free all you have to do is
1:44
like this video subscribe to the channel and comment below and you're going to get the four-part AI FastTrack training
1:51
plus an optional 30-day trial to the best AI software out there that I know of that I've been using to make money
1:57
over the last 30 days just like this so this is a picture of my square account
2:05
and obviously I blurred out the information but you can see that this is
2:11
today the 17th top rightand corner and you know this one is $125 payment couple
2:17
days ago $264 payment couple of days before that 2,225 1225 so these payments they go all
2:26
the way up to 12,000 this is not just any type of income this is subscription income and
2:33
that is what I want everybody on my channel to get which is more subscription income so now that we've
2:40
gotten all that out of the way let's talk about Manis AI for a second because Manis Manus Manis the general AI
2:50
agent so they have a website if you go to their website they talk about how it's a
2:57
general AI agent that Bridges the minds and actions it doesn't just just think it delivers results Manis excels at
3:03
various tasks in work in life getting everything done while you rest and you know I can verify just from using this
3:10
thing the way that I got my attention was captured by Manis was by this viral
3:18
tweet that went it went viral and it it shares that Manis under the hood when
3:24
you ask it to do stuff actually can automate over 50 complex tasks at once it research it writes it schedules it
3:31
summarizes and does more without human input and when you do give it a task it
3:37
shows you or gives you the ability to monitor the the screen the desktop of
3:42
Manis which is pretty interesting because it's like you're working with somebody or you're watching over the
3:47
shoulder as somebody works and again Manis is it's just groundbreaking
3:53
because it's an action taker unlike normal llms it's just it's it's not just
4:01
a query based system and so that went viral now I
4:07
mentioned that Manis is uh right now it's kind of like on an invite only
4:13
basis so if you go to their website let's see if I can pull it up in private
4:19
mode if you go to get started it asks you to give it an invitation code and
4:27
there have been people that are paying thousands of dollars for these invitation codes and I was able to
4:34
get access within I don't know 5 hours and uh I was actually able to get a
4:40
bunch of people access within a couple hours you can see task meal says that
4:46
did the trick been waight listed for days uh somebody else said I signed up with three different emails this one
4:52
worked Nick tells us to sign up but then you teach people how to make money with AI Manis sends me an invite in two hours
4:57
Nick you're were the man Barbara Golding I'm in uh rod says
5:03
um he reapplied in a different account using the tip and got immediate approval definitely the secret sauce Manis AI is
5:10
absolutely gamechanging and my favorite of all them and I would agree so as a
5:15
subscriber to this Channel I want to tell you what I did to get in when I went in here and I requested invitation
5:21
to Manis I put in my email and it said what use case would you like Manis
5:30
to execute for you and I said to help me with digital marketing and for my
5:36
profession this is the key part I said that I teach people to make money with
5:41
AI and that is what I have told all these people to do and most of them got in so if you get in and you get accepted
5:49
please make sure to share this video share it with a friend like it subscribe if you haven't already again I'm going
5:55
to give you this document uh for free with my 30-day or my 30-day trial plus 4 days of AI FastTrack training and
6:03
obviously the content here is going to be fire because I'm going to show you some stuff that I've already been using to make money but with the addition of
6:10
Manis as well so now that you have Manis let's jump back over to my slides
6:15
here a lot of talk lot to talk about today so I made some slides just to stay on
6:20
task so I was first blown away when I asked Manis with a simple
6:28
task to make me a website one of the first things I said you can see this
6:35
query Series in my queue here I said make me a website for my YouTube
6:42
channel and it says I'll help you create a website for the YouTube channel let me
6:47
gather information so it went out and gathered the information about the channel and I think if I click the share
6:55
button you can see what I'm talking about when it goes through the multi tasks and you can watch it watch
7:02
this thinking initializing look at this research that it's doing how freaking mindblowing is that I saw
7:10
my website that was my marketing agency's website pop up thinking analyzing
7:17
ter just mind-blowing so this this image here it really is
7:24
real and so not only did it
7:29
research me and everything about my YouTube channel but look at it see it building that it built a
7:38
fully uh executed and deployed website on this
7:44
development domain and it has everything about me it has profile image placeholders based in Maui Hawaii it
7:51
knows exactly where I'm from it has all links to all my featured videos it has about me researched has all the topics
7:58
of the YouTube channel it even took Google reviews from another company of
8:03
mine and put it on the website now you guys this is crazy because this is the
8:09
type of thing that we sell to small businesses for $500 $3,000 we sell custom websites for
8:16
up to $88,000 and sometimes $112,000 for e-commerce websites depending on how big they are we usually Outsource the work
8:22
or we have a specialist That's inhouse on our team to help us build these
8:27
things look at how low the barrier to entry is to get started if you have no
8:33
technical experience Kevin Hawthorne how you doing good evening from Lakeland
8:38
Florida it is absolutely Bonkers where this is going and this is just the beginning right we're just getting
8:45
started so this really did catch my attention again not just build me a or
8:51
build me a website or give me content chat gbt deep seek these other AI tools
8:58
I have yet to see one do this deploy a website and have it set up content
9:05
implemented design implemented that is groundbreaking now since that caught my
9:12
attention I started to do some other things uh I asked it to write a 30d 30-day email sequence for my business
9:18
because that's one of the things that has been on my to-do list list for a while so started to think of all the
9:24
things that I have been slacking off on like oh well if Manis is real and it can
9:30
help me do all the stuff that is difficult what is what else is on my
9:36
list of things that I need to get done that I have been slacking off on but I'm
9:42
an Executor so I don't slack off on a lot there's just some things in there that take a little more time a little
9:47
more timec consuming tasks one of them is to get a 30-day email sequence about
9:53
Hawaii because we're a Hawaii based business you can't just have chat gbt write a 30-day email sequence because
9:59
there Nuance to doing business here that if you write an email sequence about Hawaii using chat gbt and you put it out
10:05
there to a bunch of businesses here they're going to immediately know that it's fake it's not written by somebody that is here it's somebody who thinks
10:12
that they're here and so there's no better way than to hurt your brand here in reputation in Hawaii by than by doing
10:18
something like that so I asked it to do the same thing uh write a 30-day email sequence about Hawaii and I said all
10:25
those things you know um where basic in Hawaii it needs to be
10:31
specific make it so that I can upload it to go high level go high level is a software tool that we use that you get
10:38
30 days free of in the four-part AI FastTrack it's optional you don't need to take it but I want to use this 30-day
10:45
email sequence to upload in the high level so we can send those emails out to all of our clients and then again you
10:51
know it I'm not going to pull it up again but it did the research it created an amazing 30-day email campaign this is
10:59
something that I would have had to hire somebody and it put it in a document for me put in a document for
11:05
me key features Hawaii specific content value driven go high level reformatted
11:12
beautiful I mean I have been trying to find somebody to write this for me for a while but I just haven't had the time to like interview and vet people and blah
11:18
blah blah blah blah so here we go manness AI just solved that problem for me now in the spirit of the series that
11:24
we have been working on in this channel making money asking deep seek Ai and other AI tools
11:32
how to make money online and verifying if those tactics work now we've gotten
11:37
some pretty good tactics out there I have asked Manis AI this query help me make
11:45
$1,000 by finding me a client to sell a digital service to by identifying a
11:52
problem and providing a solution how to find the prospect a creative tactic to get their contact info a creative way to
11:58
get their attention the digital service itself that I should sell them how to deliver it include all the assets I will
12:04
need including any scripts templates PDFs DMS emails presentations fulfillment Sops and more I didn't leave
12:11
any stone unturned right I wanted to make it as easy as possible for anybody watching this it doesn't have any
12:18
technical skill set that is brand new which you can be you're watching this now you're seeing
12:24
this make it as easy as humanly possible to get this out there and as I said at
12:29
the beginning of the video it actually told me a method that I should do to
12:34
make money that I know already Works which is great because I've already vetted it now it did give me some things
12:41
and some tactics to make it better and I actually have some things and some tactics to make it better so that's what I'm going to share with you so
12:49
um it did say full disclosure and I by the way Manis AI does not pay me to make
12:54
this video or anything like that this is just a full I'm trying this stuff out said due to the high current High service load task cannot be created I
13:01
immediately just press it again and then it uh created everything for me so I'm
13:06
going to go to the bottom and scroll up a little bit
13:12
because you guys the the method it gave me complete social media
13:19
management business plan so before you say social media manag what the heck is that stick with me here because it's not
13:25
what you think so it did the market research right small businesses digital
13:31
marketing challenges remember problem solution whenever we want to sell something online we need to find somebody that has a problem we offer
13:37
them a solution we know that AI right now is set to become a trillion doll
13:44
industry a lot of business owners know about AI but they don't know where to start and so right now we have been
13:52
getting paid to connect business owners with AI software tools and essentially
13:57
that is exactly what man told us to do uh you do this by finding a problem and offering a solution the solution is
14:04
usually AI software because that is something new that is a tool that many
14:09
people have yet to adopt that they don't even know about but they know that they need it so it is very relevant right now
14:16
and easy to actually get some traction and closed deals with so small
14:23
businesses digital marketing challenges of 25 2025 time constraints for consistent marketing efforts keeping up
14:28
with with platform algorithm changes creating engaging content regularly measuring Roi from digital marketing
14:35
limiting technical experience and resources now I know this because I have a marketing company and we have over 50
14:41
clients right now these are all things that they struggle with these are all things that
14:47
we help them with uh most importantly time constraints for consistent
14:52
marketing efforts so the average business owner is busy running their business you know a Solar Company owner
15:01
he's not out there trying to post on his social media he is busy running his business and so he's going to use some
15:08
money that he makes from the solar jobs that he sells to reinvest into posting on social media now most of
15:15
them have a difficult time finding somebody to do this or don't even know where to start so don't even look pipsy
15:21
says hi welcome pipsy and so let's keep going with what Mana says
15:27
Service opportunity analysis after research various digital opportunities SEO content creation conversion optimization AI
15:33
implementation social media management emerges the most profitable service because clear pricing Benchmark at
15:40
$1,000 a month recurring Revenue potential this is the subscription based income I'm talking about scalable
15:45
service model high demand along small businesses leverageable with AI tools measurable results relatively low bar to
15:51
entry this you guys I could not have said better myself I have taught many
15:56
people to make money with social media and not social media marketing by the way so let's talk about
16:04
because I I saw it actually so it tells you the industries to go after but not social media marketing right there's a
16:11
difference so acquisition
16:20
tactics so the whole point is and and I saw it in here somewhere um it's not
16:26
about marketing on social media it's about posting on on social media now there's a difference because when you
16:31
offer here we go ideal client profile business size 5 to 50 employees Revenue
16:37
$250,000 to $5 million annually this is The Sweet Spot current social media has
16:43
accounts but post infrequently or ineffectively decision maker owner or
16:48
marketing manager who has time constraint so there's a difference between doing
16:54
social media marketing which is doing things on social media to get
17:00
customers and social media posting which is making uh social media account look
17:08
active because let's say you go to a restaurant right now or you're looking to go to a restaurant right now and
17:14
you're on vacation you're with your significant other and you're looking for a restaurant in an
17:19
area and you type in restaurants on Google you find a restaurant there's no reviews you're going to be
17:26
like moving on right you're going to go to the next one you're that that place isn't open you're going to think it's not good it's not open so you have to
17:32
have reviews of course you might even go look up their their website or their menu or their social media if you go to
17:38
their social media and you see that they haven't posted in four or five years you're also going to think that
17:45
they are inactive or they have nothing fresh or new to talk about and it's not very exciting we all know that a healthy
17:51
active business is healthy and active on social media which means posting on
17:56
social media now this is exactly what Manis is saying that we do find the pain points for the business
18:03
owners who know social media is important but lacks time to management to manage it concerned about keeping up
18:10
with platform changes so that's exactly it and I like this service and I teach
18:15
it to people because it's an activity-based service you get paid for
18:20
posting five times a week on the social media account not for bringing 500
18:27
people to the restaurant which is much more difficult it's a whole another service we can talk about that it's usually paid advertising lead generation
18:34
search engine optimization all those things for this video for getting paid $1,000 a month or maybe using this
18:41
service to add into something that you already sell like Google ads or SEO sell an activity based service you get paid
18:47
for the activity the activity is posting once per day or once every other day or whatever the cadences that you want to
18:53
sell on social media as long as those posts go out then you will get paid uh
19:01
somebody's asking about the prompt that I Ed yeah if you like this video subscribe to this channel share with a friend comment below I will give you the
19:08
document the complete document The Prompt and also access to my free
19:14
four-part AI FastTrack training with a 30-day trial to the best software out
19:19
there for sales and marketing it's called high level normally the trial is only 14 days but you get 30 days for free it's optional uh but the AI
19:26
FastTrack training is going deeper in the methods and tactics that I use that I teach here in this Channel that I vet
19:31
to know uh actually working to get clients thank you for asking pipsy he says got it appreciate you I'll send
19:37
that over to you so um activity Based
19:43
Services social media posting and I'm going to go I'm going to show you on High level actually in a second where we use AI to create all the posts we use AI
19:50
to create all the images and we can have 30 days of social media automated and
19:55
posted in like 30 minutes get paid $1,000 a month who would take that deal
20:01
anybody I love what Manis AI did here though because it also tells me because
20:07
I requested how to find people that need this so it says prospecting finding
20:13
methods local business research use Google Maps to identify businesses and Target Industries visit websites and
20:19
social media to assess current presence score businesses on need and ability to pay beautiful so if you go to Google and
20:26
you type in roofer uh Santan Valley is somewhere that I've been looking at
20:33
o sorry everybody I'm going to back up real quick because I wasn't sharing my screen I was just looking at this uh
20:39
prospecting finding methods using Google Maps to identify businesses and Target in our area visit websites and social
20:45
media to sess current presence so I go to Google I type in roofer Santan Valley and then what I
20:54
suggest is you don't go after the high density areas you know you're not going
21:00
to go to Los Angeles to look for roofers go to the suburbs in the in the smaller areas because that's going to be where
21:06
you have less competition you can find people that are going to actually be able to pay you now if you find some go to go to the map
21:13
section click the top maps and you can quickly see the businesses that have
21:19
websites here ultimate Roofing Santan Valley website 44 reviews Arizona's
21:24
Finance Roofing 101 let's see what somebody with a 100 reviews see if we can find their social
21:31
media Arizona's finest so they have all the all the
21:36
bells and whistles right their website is looking pretty good they got a video they got social they got uh blog
21:44
posts but I'm not seeing any links to their social media here so let's go let's just go directly to
21:50
Facebook we'll pull up Arizona's finest Roofing
21:58
Arizona's finest Roofing so one of them says it's closed
22:04
now oh maybe this is business owners operations so let's see that logo looks familiar so let's click on this
22:11
one 398 likes 377 followers see so this
22:18
guy knows what's up so he uh he has been last post July 255th 2024 but look at
22:25
this he actually took the time to create a good video so this guy could be a good candidate right because he posted in
22:33
2024 July August we're we're talking around 6
22:39
months or longer so he obviously knows the value in
22:44
social media but don't you think he'd probably want to be posting at least a few times a month to maintain his activity so this
22:52
would be a good one and I'm not going to go too deep into like the the researching what you want to find is somebody who hasn't posted years
22:59
somebody who just like this who who clearly knows the value in posting but hasn't been posting so let's go let's
23:05
move on to the next step here because Mana says go out find local business research they have the need and the
23:12
ability to pay that guy looks pretty credible they have clients they got reviews they've already made content before I like it I looked at their
23:19
social media search um identify businesses with inconsistent posting and low engagement and you can keep a
23:25
spreadsheet and add people to your list that's probably a better way to do this but for the sake of brevity and for this
23:30
video I'm not doing that I'm just walking you through some of these steps LinkedIn sales Navigator approach I
23:36
wouldn't even do that it's giving you other ways to do that you can be successful with the social media and Google and that's it like I see people
23:43
all the time if you go to my Facebook group offlin shark.com
23:51
and you search for the hasht win this is
23:57
uh what the people in my my community we got 7,000 177,000 people in here that are all following these methods uh to
24:04
get strategies and if you go here and you type in the hashtag win this is what
24:10
people do to Signal every time they land a deal so this guy March 14th $555
24:17
landing page job to a bookkeeper awesome Donna Norris
24:24
win lots of deals $3500 a month $99 7 uh two new AI SAS clients $597 a month so
24:34
these tactics work right I know these methods work I've taught these methods to a lot of people this is basic simple
24:40
prospecting 101 going to Google finding problems offering Solutions social media
24:47
posting is totally a problem people know that they need it you don't need to go into LinkedIn
24:53
this is totally good enough uh competitor client research obvious obviously that's going to help you I now
24:58
let's jump into this part weekly prospecting schedule I love this because most people are not successful because
25:05
they don't take action so don't be that person be an action taker be an action
25:12
taker somebody who actually wants to secure a brighter future for tomorrow
25:18
and a lot of people watching this video will say like I want to do this but they don't know where to start so write down a commitment right now you're going to
25:25
do a weekly prospecting schedule on Monday or whatever day it is today it's Monday Monday start Tuesday research 20 new prospects using the method that I
25:32
just showed you put them on a list and then we're going to do Outreach we're going to give you the email Outreach directly from Manis and offer to give
25:39
them this solution for their problem
25:44
so screenshot this comment below for the actual document if you want to just copy
25:49
and paste it but you have to stay consistent this is what people don't do
25:55
they do not stay consistent they try one two or three times or send out two or three
26:01
emails or two or three phone calls or DMS or whatever but look in the beginning you got to be consistent and
26:07
if all you do is set a number for 20 contact touch points then hit that
26:14
number every single day and then feel confident and feel good about making progress and over time you're going to
26:19
get better you're going to get faster you're going to see what works you're going to be able to adapt and make things even better and that's what
26:26
people are doing in our community that get traction but here today on this video if you're brand new this is where you should start if you're just looking
26:32
to add things and go to the next level this is where you should start as well I have um seen
26:39
people take this method and build sixf figure businesses so it really does work
26:45
somebody says I have too many questions go to the Facebook group ask some questions there's 17 other people in
26:51
there that are getting traction and also join the four-part AI FastTrack series because it's free and we go deep deeper
26:59
than what I'm doing here on this video so make sure you set your schedule for
27:04
your prospecting now let's talk about acquisition tactics the social media
27:09
audit approach create a free valuable social media performance score complete this audit for each Prospect it takes 15
27:16
to 20 minutes include specific actionable tips delivered via direct message email or in person so it gives
27:24
you a template here their name prepared by their date overall performance score so it's it's saying that you can go out
27:30
there and check how often they post posting
27:35
consistency uh platform assessment how good and well they're posting on each platform detailed breakdown content
27:42
quality engagement rate all these things that's that's a little too timec consuming for me um industry Benchmark
27:49
method create an industry specific social media Benchmark report pretty cool I like I like the
27:55
email uh Outreach um hi subject name I've just completed a
28:02
comprehensive analysis of social media performance across X number of platforms the report includes blah blah blah blah blah as the owner of this business this
28:08
data could help you identify to receive a free copy of The Benchmark report simply click the link I like to create
28:15
what's called an irresistible offer to get the attention of people and so for me in this situation what I would do is
28:22
I would use high level I would use a social planner to create 30 days free of
28:27
social media content for the business owner I'd say hey I noticed you haven't posted in 6 months I got 30 days free
28:33
here it is give it to him in a spreadsheet you can actually do that with high level export it all on a spreadsheet you and you can also say if
28:40
you want I can use my software that can publish and post this to all of your platforms again it's free if you like
28:45
what I give to you we can talk about payment for the next month but no worries if not 30 days is free it's on
28:52
the house that's an irresistible offer for a guy like this who's already been post in but
28:59
hasn't posted in 6 months he's probably be like ah thank God thank you for taking that off my plate I really appreciate it so I like that offer a
29:07
little bit better um local business feature interview script feature your business uh local
29:14
Spotlight I actually like that one as well uh we have a tool and I
29:20
think I think I saw this in here somewhere something about directories
29:27
local business features start an Instagram Facebook page called your business
29:34
Spotlight business interview survey so one thing that we did we have
29:39
a we have a website that we call Hawaii thrive.com and this is a directory based
29:45
website and we give businesses in our area listings on the site so this is a free listing we give them premium
29:51
listings premium listings allow you to put videos their menus they get a little more functionality free listing things
29:58
are free they look very basic just like this they have their name address phone number and their image now the tool goes
30:04
out there and builds all these listings I just type in sushi restaurants Maui and it'll give
30:11
me all the businesses that are sushi restaurants in Google I'll select them all I'll import them and they get a
30:16
listing on this website we then contact all those businesses and say hey you have a free
30:22
advertisement on our website it's called Hawai thrive.com and that's how we start the prospecting method oh by the way
30:29
we've created 30 days free social media content for you if you want it just respond to this email and we can talk
30:34
about you know what it looks like to keep using us moving forward if not no worries we do that at at scale right um
30:41
if you like this method you can go to smart directory. we're about to launch the new
30:47
version of this on the highle platform you can see a demo of this uh it's going to be rolling out in the next couple
30:54
weeks but you can get on the wait list if you want smart directory. this video is not a plug for that but it is the
31:00
best tool out there to do this so I like that method too the uh business
31:06
Spotlight approach this is a version of that that I like and and use really well
31:12
um social media makeover so kind of a before and after thing that works really
31:18
well in all you guys Manis is pretty incredible I think you can
31:25
agree when it comes to everything from finding what you're offering researching
31:33
prospecting and even this section service package and pricing social media
31:38
growth system $1,000 a month it tells you 12 custom posts per month three times per week professional graphics and
31:45
images uh account management daily monitoring of Engagement growth tactics targeting follow I would I would
31:51
probably like I said leave this part out it's more about the activity of
31:56
posting uh there's three tiered pricing structure 750 a month two platforms
32:02
eight custom post basic content calendar $11,000 a month three platforms 12 custom posts $1,500 a month four okay so
32:09
this is Awesome by the way that is all included here in this document that I'm giving you for commenting below and then
32:15
there's you know email templates that you can use that say uh this is the outreached email template I already
32:22
shared you can edit that um to talk about the free 30 days of
32:27
social mediate content and so on and so let's talk
32:33
about that a little bit because I think some people might be saying to themselves well how do I create social media content I think we've gotten to
32:39
that point so if I go to the highle app and I log in I go to the marketing
32:44
section I go to the social planner section here by the way you get 30 days free if
32:50
you go to the AI FastTrack training you you like this video subscribe comment below I'll send you the link you get 30
32:56
days free as an option to try and play with this and you do not need the full 30 days to get your first client that
33:03
will pay for this tool by itself by the way but let me show you how easy it is to create social media content so social
33:09
planner new post I click content
33:17
AI now I'm going to give it a title um social media for
33:25
or Roofing rep placement post for a roofer to get more
33:33
customers let's try this angle B2B keywords roofer select writing tone funny casual
33:40
excited I'm going to go with professional number of variations I'm going to go with five variations so I get five versions of
33:47
this post back length of content small medium large let's go with medium hit
33:53
generate now what the tool is doing is it's going out and it's creating content
34:00
around Roofing jobs or people that need roofing jobs like this is your roof
34:10
showing signs of wear and tear don't wait for a leak to tell you it's time for replacement as an expert roofer with
34:15
years of experience I specialize in providing top-notch Roofing Replacements that ensure your home stays safe and dry
34:20
all the hashtags schedule appointment so it gives you five different versions is your roof ready for a transformation is
34:27
your roof ready for a
34:32
makeover I like the first one is your roof showing signs of wear and tear because that's a common one so I hit
34:39
copy That's My Chosen content right there I hit
34:45
continue and all I have to do is select all the social media accounts that I want to
34:51
publish this to by the way somebody asked me about this recently they said how do I get access
34:59
to the social media accounts to from from the business to post to is it going
35:04
to be challenging to get all their usernames and passwords to do that to so not when you use high level so when you
35:10
use this tool right here all you do is go in the settings section and create them a username and password and you say
35:16
hey here's your username and password to my tool go in there and connect your social media accounts so all they have
35:22
to do is log in link their Facebook link their Instagram link whatever they want you to be posting to you don't ever get
35:28
their passwords it's linked and you can see it here in there just like this and so when it comes time for you to create
35:34
the posts you just select which platforms you want to post to and you
35:39
can hit select all and you can post to all of them all at once or just individually but keep in mind this
35:45
feature in itself is super valuable because this guy he's probably just posting to his
35:52
Facebook page he's probably not posting to all these Pages because he doesn't know about tools like this and so for
35:59
you to come in and say hey I'll post to all your social media platforms for free for 30 days if you
36:07
like what you're getting we can talk about payment later no worries if not no pressure irresistible offer so then you
36:14
come in here you create this content obviously we're going to need an image for this post so we hit the image
36:20
side create image icon create image using
36:25
gallery describe your image new roof number of variations three I like
36:32
to always pump up the number of variations because like with AI sometimes they don't create the Right image or they don't create the right
36:37
content you want a couple different versions if possible and then you have all the different types of image Styles
36:43
dreamlike digital art poster colorful pastel animated sketch I'm going to go
36:48
with photo just because it's a roofing job we want to kind of be professional it wouldn't really I guess you could use
36:55
digital art or colorful like I guess that could work sometimes uh photo will
37:00
have some sense of realism I guess you could say to
37:07
it boom new roof I can pick any one of
37:14
these that's pretty sick right uh pipsy says cartoon roof won't
37:20
work well it could you know this is like a 3D AI roof which I think is cool it's
37:26
kind of like the roof of my house actually but look at that I just created a professional written post professional
37:32
image and I can schedule this to post tomorrow or the next day you can see right here it
37:38
says schedule post I can even send it to for approval to the business owner once
37:44
it's done I can say hey I created this post let me know if it looks good he'll get a link to his email he'll open up
37:50
the link and then he'll say this is good to post to my social media that way you don't just post stuff to their social
37:56
media and piss them off like they they see it later and they're like hey this is totally off brand but you can send it
38:01
to approval if you send it to them for approval if that's something that you want to do which is great it even adds
38:07
another layer of professionalism but once you get them all created you can create 30 days of
38:13
this within 30 minutes you guys and you can get paid $1,000 a month for something like this you schedule it and
38:20
you're Off to the Races right how many clients do you think that you could get
38:27
per month doing this you know if you follow the numbers from Manis contacted
38:32
20 businesses per day 20 businesses per day and I can tell you from our sales
38:38
numbers at our business we we try to contact 50 businesses per day uh 50
38:44
calls per day 250 calls per week that's five uh five days a week that should
38:51
give you five to 10 responses from people and you should close one to two
38:57
of those people and so if you close one to two people at $1,000 a month within 4 weeks you're making $4 to $8,000 a month
39:06
this is where people retire early by doing something like this this is where they quit their job this is why if you
39:11
go into our Facebook group you see a lot of people that have success in the methods that that we share because they work but you have to be an action taker
39:19
you have to be willing to put in the Reps it's not automatic what I like to see here from
39:26
this representation today is that Manis has given us end to end
39:32
instruction in something I know to work I've seen many people use this method the 30-day free social media posting you
39:39
go to my Facebook group and verify for yourself and you know it's it it works
39:45
really well so I think it's pretty cool because it's not out there just giving
39:50
fluff away it's not telling you to do things that are not real it's do it's telling you to do things that work and
39:58
it's pretty amazing that the first method that came back was this method and um I've taught it to a lot of
40:05
people so you guys how awesome is that uh I hope that you got some value out of
40:11
