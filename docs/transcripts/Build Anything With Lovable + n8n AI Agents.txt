this is how you can build anything with
0:02
Lovable and NN in this video we're going
0:04
to build a custom AI voice assistant app
0:07
that can handle simple everyday tasks
0:09
like sending emails scheduling event
0:11
your calendar and adding items in your
0:13
to-do list we will use Lovable to build
0:16
a front end which is basically the
0:17
visual interface people interact with
0:19
and we will use N to build a back end
0:22
which is basically what is happening
0:23
behind the interface and gives us the
0:25
actual results of our app now the first
0:27
thing we need to do is to create a road
0:29
map for our app so we know exactly what
0:31
steps we should take to actually start
0:33
building it so I will come over to chip
0:35
and type I want to build a voice
0:37
assistant app with lovable and n in
0:39
which I will be able to send a voice
0:41
message in lovable interface and then it
0:44
will go over to n where the automation
0:46
will decide whether it should send an
0:48
email schedule an event my calendar or
0:50
add something to my to-do list give me
0:52
the exact road map of how I can do that
0:54
and click on enter and guys the reason
0:56
we're doing that is so we know the exact
0:58
process we need to follow because
1:00
sometimes we might have something in our
1:02
mind but we actually might need to do
1:04
more steps in order to be able to
1:06
achieve it and it would be better for us
1:08
to be prepared so we prompt Lovable
1:10
accordingly at the start rather than us
1:12
trying to troubleshoot after Lovable has
1:15
already made the vast majority of the
1:16
app and as you can see Tajib gave us an
1:19
exact road map of what we need to do and
1:21
the reason we use such a guys is because
1:23
as you guys can see step one basically
1:26
create the lovable interface step two
1:28
set up n automation which is fine but
1:30
then step three we have a problem there
1:33
is no module in n which can actually
1:35
recognize voice and transcribe it into
1:38
text and also lovable cannot by itself
1:40
recognize speech and transcribe it into
1:42
text so we'll need to adding something
1:45
in between those two so our voice
1:47
actually gets transcribed and then sent
1:49
in N which is actually pretty simple to
1:51
do but it is a step that a lot of people
1:53
actually get stuck on never complete and
1:55
that's why you will be able to
1:56
differentiate yourself by building this
1:58
app but let's first start with step
2:01
number one which is none other than
2:03
building the actual interface to do that
2:05
I will simply ask hey give me a prompt I
2:08
can give to lovable to build me an
2:10
interface for this app exactly as I want
2:12
and I will simply click on enter and now
2:15
will literally give me the exact prompt
2:17
i can use Lovable to build me this
2:18
interface so SJ gave me this prompt i
2:21
will simply come over here copy it come
2:23
back over to Lovable paste it and simply
2:26
click on enter so while Lovable is
2:28
actually building our interface let's
2:30
actually build the back end of our app
2:32
so I will go over to N i will leave a
2:34
link for it in the description below if
2:36
you don't have an account you can just
2:37
simply create one it's super simple and
2:39
we'll simply come over here and click on
2:41
create workflow so right now we have a
2:43
brand new workflow and now the first
2:45
thing that we need to do is to actually
2:47
come over here click on add first step
2:49
and over here we have the triggers which
2:51
is how workflow will actually start and
2:53
we will search for web hook now what is
2:55
a web hook exactly it is a module which
2:58
will connect a front end interface in
3:00
lovable with a backend automation that
3:02
we're going to create in it so basically
3:05
think of it as the connector between the
3:06
two so we will click it and over here we
3:09
have this URL we will click it and the
3:11
only thing we need to do in this module
3:13
is simply to come over here in the HTTP
3:16
method and simply change it from get to
3:18
post and now we'll just simply come over
3:20
here click on top of it to copy the link
3:22
and we'll come over to Lovable which
3:24
actually finish building the app which
3:26
is great and we'll just simply paste it
3:28
over here and say this is the link for
3:30
the web hook from N make sure to connect
3:33
it so it's able to receive a post
3:35
request and now because I would want a
3:37
text box as well underneath the mic so I
3:39
can also manually type what I want my
3:42
app to do in addition to speaking i will
3:44
also say also add in a text box in which
3:46
I can also type my props underneath the
3:48
microphone in addition to speaking and I
3:50
will simply click on enter and now
3:52
Lovable will make both of these changes
3:54
and I will be back with you once it is
3:56
done and boom guys Lovable just finished
3:58
making the changes and as you can see it
4:00
successfully added this text box
4:02
underneath the microphone so we can also
4:04
type if we don't want to speak at that
4:06
moment so now let's actually test it to
4:08
see if it actually is able to send the
4:10
data inside N but before we say anything
4:13
we first need to go over to N double
4:15
click on the web hook and make sure we
4:17
click on laser for test event so our web
4:20
hook is actively listening and it's
4:22
waiting for data to come in from Lovable
4:24
and now we simply come back to Lovable
4:26
and type hey can you send an email to
4:28
Mark and I will simply come over here
4:30
and click on enter and we will click on
4:32
send command was sent successfully now
4:34
if we go back to NN we can actually see
4:37
the message we sent as you can see over
4:38
here guys message hey can you send an
4:41
email to Mark this is simply amazing so
4:44
that's great we successfully managed to
4:45
connect our web hook in Lovable and now
4:47
it's actually time to build the
4:49
automation so we'll click off the web
4:51
hook module and now it's time to add in
4:53
an AI agent so I will simply click on
4:55
add i will click on AI and I will click
4:57
on AI agent and now just to explain it
5:00
what this AI agent will do it will
5:02
basically receive the message from
5:03
Lovable it will analyze it and then it
5:06
will decide whether it wants to send an
5:08
email it wants to schedule an event in a
5:10
calendar or it wants to add something in
5:12
our to-do list always based on the
5:14
message we gave it inside Lovable so the
5:17
first thing that we need to do is to
5:18
come over here where it says source for
5:20
prompt click on it and we'll click on
5:22
define below since we're not using a
5:25
trigger nor we're actually using a web
5:26
cook so we'll click on define below and
5:28
over here we will actually scroll all
5:30
the way down here to where it says
5:32
message which is basically the message
5:34
that we sent from lovable to NNN and we
5:36
simply drag and drop this all the way
5:38
over here and we could say something
5:40
like this is what you should do and now
5:43
the only other thing we have to do in
5:45
our AI agent is to simply come over here
5:48
to options click on add option and click
5:50
on system message and here we'll
5:52
basically need to describe in our AI
5:54
agent exactly what it needs to do based
5:57
on the message it receives so I wrote
6:00
you are an assistant that receives user
6:01
request decides whether the user wants
6:04
to send an email schedule a calendar
6:06
event or add a to-do list item choose
6:08
the correct action and provide the
6:10
necessary details for that action so how
6:12
I created this prompt was basically I
6:14
came over to AI assistant i basically
6:17
explained exactly what I want the AI
6:19
agent to do and literally gave me the
6:21
prompt that I simply copy pasted this is
6:23
a very underrated feature i don't know
6:25
why a lot of people not using it it
6:27
literally saves you so much time so now
6:29
that we finished our prompt we'll simply
6:31
click off of it and we'll click on save
6:33
always make sure you're saving your
6:35
progress because N doesn't automatically
6:37
save it and now it's time to add in the
6:39
model the AI agent will use so we'll
6:42
simply come over here and click on the
6:43
plus icon and over here we can select
6:46
from all these models you can pick each
6:48
one that you want i will personally
6:50
select Google Gemini for this video
6:52
since it is also free and everyone can
6:54
use it so if this box is actually empty
6:56
for you because you haven't actually
6:58
created any API keys over here you will
7:00
simply click on create new credential
7:02
and over here it will ask you for the
7:04
API key now how you can find this key
7:06
simple you come over to Google AI
7:08
studio/ API keys and you will simply
7:10
come over here and click on create API
7:12
key i will also leave the link for this
7:14
in the description below over here we
7:16
simply select the Google project i will
7:19
select this one for example and I will
7:21
click on create API key this will give
7:23
you your API key you will simply click
7:25
on copy come back to NN and simply paste
7:28
over here in the API key box and then
7:31
simply click on save and now as you can
7:33
see credential successfully was created
7:35
now we can click off of this and now we
7:37
simply need to select the model i will
7:39
select Gemini 2.5 plus you can select
7:42
which model you want doesn't really
7:44
matter we will not do anything else we
7:46
simply click off of it and now we have
7:48
successfully add in our AI model now
7:50
what we need to do is to actually add in
7:52
some memory so I will click on add over
7:54
here i will add some simple memory and I
7:56
will make the context window 10 you can
7:58
leave it at five it is fine what that
8:00
basically is is how many past
8:02
interactions you will remember so I will
8:04
leave it at 10 and why we add memory is
8:06
because if we actually give insufficient
8:09
information to the AI agent it will
8:11
actually be able to send us a message
8:12
back to ask for more information so it
8:15
can actually complete the task which is
8:16
very important that's the reason we
8:18
actually added the memory so now we
8:20
actually need to add in the tools so
8:21
let's add in our first tool which will
8:23
be none other than Gmail so we'll simply
8:26
come over here click on the plus icon
8:28
and we will come over here and simply
8:29
search for Gmail as you can see Gmail 2
8:32
the first thing you actually need to do
8:33
if you have not created your Gmail
8:35
account is to actually create it so you
8:37
will come over here and click on update
8:39
credentials and over here if you haven't
8:41
actually created your account you will
8:42
see O2 login you will simply click on it
8:46
so you will basically sign in the Gmail
8:48
account you want the emails to be sent
8:49
from it is a very simple process you
8:51
simply click on sign in with Google you
8:53
select your account you will simply
8:55
allow it and then what it needs you to
8:57
allow and you click on continue and you
9:00
will see this message where it says
9:01
connection successful so after you see
9:04
that message it means that you
9:05
successfully connected your Google
9:06
account so then you will be able to
9:08
click off here and now that you have
9:10
done that all of the settings are
9:12
exactly as we want them we want to set
9:15
automatically we want the res to be a
9:17
message and operation to be to send we
9:19
don't want to do anything else so all
9:21
these three things were by default
9:23
exactly what we wanted and now in this
9:25
box we select which person we're going
9:27
to send the message to we'll simply come
9:29
over here in the magic button and click
9:31
it to let the AI model define it we can
9:34
also add in a description if we want
9:36
there's no need to add an actual
9:38
description we'll do the same with
9:40
subject and we will also do the exact
9:42
same with message and we'll change the
9:45
email type from HTML to text and we're
9:48
basically done with the Gmail module so
9:50
we just need to click off of here and
9:52
let's actually test it so I will first
9:54
come over to the web hook make sure it
9:56
listens for test event don't forget that
9:58
guys it is very important it will not be
10:00
able to bring the data from lovable and
10:02
I will go back to Lovable and we will
10:04
type and I said "Hey send an email to
10:07
NFT average owner gmail.com this is my
10:10
actual fake email subject should be
10:12
hello description should be please like
10:15
this video." And we simply click over
10:17
here and send this request command was
10:19
sent successfully and now if we go back
10:21
to N you can see over here we did
10:23
receive it and if we come back over to
10:26
the AI agent here we click it we can see
10:28
Arbor okay I have sent the email great
10:31
and now we go to our email you can see
10:33
over here to NFT average owner please
10:36
like this video exactly as we prompted
10:39
the AI to do that's great so that means
10:42
that the Gmail module actually works now
10:44
it's time to add in the next function
10:46
which will be scheduling Google calendar
10:48
events so we'll come back over to NN and
10:51
we'll simply come over here to tool and
10:52
click on the plus icon and now we will
10:54
search for Google calendar we will click
10:57
on the Google calendar tool and over
10:59
here if you connected your Google
11:00
account before you will also have it
11:03
connect over here so simply select it
11:05
then the tool description we will leave
11:07
it on set automatically on the resource
11:09
leave it on event operation we will
11:11
leave it on create since we want to
11:13
create an event we don't want to do any
11:15
of these other functions and over here
11:17
in the calendar we can either select a
11:20
calendar or we can let the AI decide for
11:22
us but if we want to let the AI decide
11:25
for us we'll need to give it information
11:26
about which calendar to use basically so
11:29
I would suggest you simply select the
11:31
one that you want so basically your main
11:33
one i will select my main one over here
11:35
and over here in the start we will leave
11:38
it as it is and on the end we will leave
11:40
it as it is as well so to test it we
11:42
will click on test workflow i will come
11:45
over to Lovable and say add in my Google
11:47
calendar at the 18th of May 2025 at 7
11:51
p.m for 1 hour the task walk my dog and
11:55
we come over here click on send and we
11:57
click on send again command was sent
11:59
successfully boom guys as you can see
12:01
the workflow was executed successfully
12:04
and if we go over to our calendar you
12:06
guys can see at the 18th of May at 7 p.m
12:10
the task walk my dog was added for
12:12
exactly one hour which is amazing and
12:14
means that the Google calendar module
12:16
works exactly as it should now let's add
12:18
in the third module in our automation so
12:21
I will come back to NN and I will come
12:23
over here again and click on tool and
12:25
this time I will search for to-do list
12:27
and here it is i will simply click on it
12:29
and again over here we need to connect
12:31
our to-do list account if you don't have
12:33
one you can simply create one and in
12:35
order to connect it you will simply go
12:37
over to your to-do list you will come
12:39
over here on your profile and you will
12:41
click on settings and then you will come
12:43
all the way down here to where it says
12:45
integrations and you will go over here
12:47
to developer and as you guys can see
12:50
over here we have our API token we'll
12:52
simply click on copy API token and you
12:55
will come back to NN just so I show you
12:57
how it is you will click over here and
12:59
you will insert your API key over here
13:02
and click on save and your to-dul
13:04
account will be successfully integrated
13:06
with NN so now we'll click off of this
13:09
and now here on the tool description
13:11
we'll leave it on set automatically on
13:12
the resource we'll leave it on task
13:14
operations we will leave it on create
13:16
since we want to create a task in our
13:19
to-do list and not do something else and
13:21
over here project name or ID again you
13:23
have two options i will select a
13:25
specific project which is for example
13:28
reading and over here again we have
13:30
label names or IDs i will fill this in
13:32
with AI and over here in the content
13:35
we'll simply come over here to where it
13:37
says message and we'll drag this inside
13:40
here and we can also say like do this
13:43
for example all right and now that we
13:45
added everything we can just simply
13:47
click off of it and test it so I will
13:49
simply come down here click on test
13:50
workflow i will come back to lovable and
13:53
type so I said hey adding a task in my
13:56
to-do list i want to read Alex Hermos's
13:59
book a $100 million offers and I will
14:02
click on enter and I will click on send
14:04
so guys it did manage to send it i just
14:06
had a very small problem i want to show
14:08
you exactly how I fixed it so basically
14:10
in the to-do list module over here I had
14:13
to just specify the exact label name of
14:16
where I want to send it and once I did
14:18
that and I came back over here and
14:20
clicked on test tab again to run the
14:22
workflow again as you can see I have
14:24
added Alex Ramos's new book in your
14:26
to-do list and if we go over in the
14:29
to-do list you can see that we have read
14:31
a $100 million offers which is great
14:34
because it does mean that we
14:36
successfully added the to-do list module
14:38
as well all right and now that we did
14:39
that the last thing we need to do is to
14:41
add in a module in which N will report
14:44
back to Lovable for exactly what it did
14:46
so in order to do that we will come over
14:48
here and we click on the plus icon and
14:50
we'll search for web hook and we will
14:53
select respond to web hook this time and
14:55
over here we can select what we wanted
14:58
to respond with i will leave it off
15:00
first incoming item and if we click over
15:02
here on test app we can see that it will
15:04
report exactly this i've added this book
15:06
in our to-do list so that looks pretty
15:08
good so basically we're done with the N
15:11
automation the only thing we have to do
15:13
is to come over here and make it active
15:15
and we'll click on it and now we're
15:17
officially done with the backend
15:19
automation N and now it's time to fix
15:21
our interface in Lovable now that we're
15:23
back to Lovable the biggest problem we
15:25
currently have with our app is when we
15:27
click on the mic it actually cannot
15:30
record the audio and it obviously cannot
15:32
describe it as well so that is something
15:33
that we definitely need to fix so in
15:35
order to do that I will come over here
15:37
enable chat mode and type hey I cannot
15:41
record audio nor transcribe it let me
15:43
know how I can record and transcribe
15:45
audio if I need to use any external
15:48
tools jb said I will need to use
15:50
something else and to embed some code in
15:53
Lovable and we'll simply click on enter
15:55
so we also get Lovables suggestions on
15:58
our issue and guys that is exactly the
16:00
reason we made the road map before
16:03
because now we do know that we would
16:05
encounter this issue and we do know how
16:07
we can fix it well if we didn't make the
16:10
road map we would be literally stuck
16:12
here and we will try to troubleshoot and
16:14
we wouldn't know why we can record audio
16:16
but now we do have that information and
16:18
we're going to address it right now and
16:20
as you can see over here lovable give us
16:23
all these options option A is to use
16:25
level apps option two is to use Open AI
16:27
whisper and option three is to use an
16:30
alternative web API based on recording
16:33
so I will come over here and say I want
16:35
to use Open AI whisper let me know
16:37
exactly how I can do that step by step
16:39
and I will click on enter and now
16:41
Lovable will literally tell us exactly
16:43
how we can use it and what we need to do
16:45
step by step to integrate it inside the
16:47
app so we can actually record and
16:49
transcribe the audio so it gave us this
16:51
plan i actually went through it already
16:54
and I will simply click on implement the
16:56
plan and now Lovable will literally
16:58
implement this plan so we're able to
17:00
actually transcribe the audio i will be
17:02
back with you once it is done and boom
17:04
Lovable just finished making the changes
17:06
and over here it basically tells us that
17:09
it implement the plan and it integrated
17:11
OpenAI's whisper but in order for us to
17:15
make it work we actually need to give it
17:16
an API key you will come over to OpenAI/
17:20
API keys i will leave a link to it in
17:22
the description below and you will
17:24
simply come over here to where it says
17:25
create new secret key click on it name
17:28
your key i will say lovable project then
17:31
over here I will select default project
17:33
and I will click on create secret key
17:35
and this will give you your API key you
17:37
obviously copy it make sure you never
17:39
share this with anyone i will delete
17:40
mine before uploading this video come
17:42
back over to Lovable paste it over here
17:45
and say this is the Open AI API key make
17:48
sure you integrate it within the app and
17:50
simply click on enter and now Lovable
17:52
will integrate this key inside our app
17:54
for us and boom lovable just finished
17:57
making the changes so let's test it out
17:59
i will come over here on the mic and
18:01
click on it and say "Hey can you add in
18:04
a task in my calendar for the 19th of
18:07
May at 400 p.m which is me creating a
18:10
new YouTube video for 1 hour open API
18:14
key not please add in settings." And as
18:16
you guys can see we do have a problem
18:18
here so we'll need to fix this the open
18:20
API key seem to not be integrated within
18:23
the app so I will simply come over here
18:25
enable chat mode and say hey lovable
18:27
tells me that open AI API key is not
18:30
inside the app and there is an error why
18:32
is that how we can fix that and I will
18:34
simply click on enter and guys like you
18:37
will run into issues like this like this
18:39
is normal where you're vibe coding the
18:41
only thing you have to do is to simply
18:43
not give up and ask the AI how you can
18:45
fix it and it will literally tell you
18:47
exactly how you can fix it which is
18:49
exactly what we're doing now so it
18:51
basically told us that the issue is
18:53
because we have a web hook API key as
18:55
well and somehow these two cannot
18:57
coexist at the same exact place so
18:59
lovable needs to modify the code a
19:01
little bit basically so they both can
19:03
coexist i will simply click on implement
19:06
the plan and now lovable will make all
19:08
the changes for us and boom lovable
19:10
finish making the changes let's test
19:12
right now so I will come over here click
19:13
on the mic hey add in an event in my
19:16
Google calendar for May of 19th at 400
19:20
PM for 3 hours which is recording a
19:24
YouTube video and look at that guys it
19:26
literally transcribed it perfectly and
19:29
now the only thing we have to do is to
19:30
simply click on send command was sent
19:32
successfully and if I go over to my
19:34
calendar you can see on May of 19th at
19:37
400 p.m we have a 3-hour blog in which I
19:40
will record a YouTube video this is
19:42
simply amazing so our app is literally
19:44
working perfectly exactly as we wanted
19:47
now what we need to do is to actually
19:48
improve the way it looks and I have a
19:50
very good and nic hack in order for us
19:52
to do that which is basically to search
19:54
for a UI of an app we actually like so
19:57
for example I found this AI assistant UI
20:00
which I actually really like so I will
20:02
simply download it come back over to
20:04
Lovable upload it and type "Hey I want
20:07
you to make our app look just like the
20:09
way this app looks make sure you don't
20:11
change any of the features that we
20:13
currently have if you want to add in
20:14
some more features from the app feel
20:16
free to do so but don't change anything
20:19
we have already done guys always make
20:21
sure you specify that if you upload an
20:23
image always tell Lovable to don't
20:25
change anything you have already done
20:27
because if you don't it actually might
20:29
start changing features you have already
20:31
added which is something you definitely
20:33
don't want to deal with so I specified
20:35
it and I will simply come over here and
20:37
click on enter and now Lovable will
20:39
literally basically mimic the UI of this
20:41
app and make our app look just like it
20:44
so I will bug with you once it is done
20:46
and boom look at that guys this
20:48
literally looks amazing and it's exactly
20:50
like the UI of this app we just uploaded
20:52
like look how good this looks if we type
20:55
oh my god this is literally just perfect
20:57
so this is the front end of our app
20:59
which we managed to build with Lovable
21:01
and this is a back end which we built in
21:03
N we could make this way better if we
21:06
actually put in more time to that for
21:08
example we could like add in a chip
21:10
module here which would take the
21:12
information from the AI agent actually
21:14
craft us a professional email and then
21:17
send it to the Gmail module over here so
21:19
it actually gets sent and we could do
21:21
that with every other module in this
21:23
list and we could even add in more so we
21:26
could make like this app all in one app
21:28
for basically everything you need to do
21:30
that you can literally do with one
21:31
simple voice message which is simply
21:33
amazing now if you want to see me
21:35
building another app with Lovable and NN
21:37
similar to this make sure you click on
21:39
this video right here and I will see you
21:41
over
