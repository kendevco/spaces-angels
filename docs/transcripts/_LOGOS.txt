Lyrics:
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

When I feel afraid,
Think I've lost my way,
Still you're there right beside me.
And nothing will I fear
As long as you are near.
Please be near me to the end.

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.

I will not forget
Your love for me and yet
My heart forever is wandering.
Jesus be my guide,
And hold me to your side,
I will love you to the end.

Nothing will I fear as long as you are near.
Please be near me to the end.

Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.
Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path,
And a light unto my path.
You're the light unto my path.

I woke up at 3 am on 3/12/25 and could not sleep. I decided to go read my bible after not really reading it for a long while. Just the occasional verse reads, which shows how lazy I have been.  As soon as I prayed and closed my Bible, God put on my heart " Your Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path". That is when I also remembered this song and how much I loved it when I was a kid/teen in the 90's. Thank you Jesus for always reminding me that you know exactly what I was needing, HIM!

1996.. my mom used to play this on piano when it was bedtime.. I was 11 and I stayed up as long as I could, just to hear it. I'm 38 now.. she's gone, almost 10 years now, but I still smile, because of the message: Today is the day that the Lord has made; I will rejoice and be glad in it.. you have to CHOOSE to rejoice today .. and every day üíñ

The story I heard was that Amy and Michael W. Smith were at a retreat of some sort and were writing songs together. As it was getting late one of the nights Michael had the music and chorus of this song but couldn‚Äôt get the verses yet. The stopped for the night and Amy walked back to her cabin to sleep in the dark. As she did she couldn‚Äôt see the path but could only see the light from her cabin. She focused on that light and just walked to it. The next day the verses wrote themselves as it were. Excellent story of the Lord leading them by experience.

First heard this when my kids were babies.  They are 37 and 39 now.  A teen gal sang it on stage at a  gymnasium being used as a sanctuary on Sunday AM.  Both that church and the Christian school are still going.  School in a diff location.  The youth pastor all those years ago has been the senior pastor at same church for about 20 years now.    I am the same  age  as he is.    We still have our  homes about two miles apart on the same road.     God is the same God. And He will be long after my short walk on earth is over.   I have several  grandchildren  now.   Going to see my 37 year old this morning who is a great mom.    Knowing  Christ  has been the most important  thing in my life for over 40 years.  Christ  transformed my life in August  1984 and by the early part of 1986 I heard this song at that large sanctuary  and my husband and I joined that church then.  He passed in late 1995.   It's  been a lot of different places  and situations  since then but this song remains fresh in my memory from that time.

This song was my wife's favorite verse in Psalms. She also sang this song in church as a solo. I consider this her signature song. She passed away two months ago today & went to be with her heavenly father. We were married 34 years. Her solo version to this song will be played at her memorial/Celebration of Life Service in May, 2022. She will be remembered by many for singing this song.

Psalms 119:105
Your word is a lamp to my feet 
And a light to my path.

Father, You provide my daily bread that nourishes my body, but it's Your Word that sustains my soul and renews my spirit. Help me to walk in the light, as You are in the light. Keep me close, Lord, walking in godly fear and holiness, attentive to Your Word and sensitive to Your Voice. Keeping me faithful and true to Your Will and Your Purpose, in Jesus' name, Amen.

Released in 1990 these lyrics spoke to me when I lived in Napa, Caiif - Amy's voice and lyrics enabled me to draw close to God when I needed Him most. Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path, when I feel afraid,  when I think I've lost my way, Still You're there right beside me...and nothing will I fear,  as long as You are near, Please be near me to the end. Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path, I will not forget, Your love for me and yet, myy heart forever is wandering, Jesus be my guide, and hold me to Your side,  I will love you to the end, nothing will I fear as long as You are near, Please be near me to the end. Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path...Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path. Thank you Amy for being steady in your faith, a great witness to the end. In 2021 a trip to Tennessee was planned, then the darkness of COVID prevented flights. Praise God in all things, always, for His Word remains a light unto my feet.  HOLA from Mexico to you and Vince, love his song about Amy giving him his first Bible.

Please keep my wife in your prayers.  She has myotonic muscular dystrophy.  Her mobility and ability to walk has regressed over the past few years.  Doctors cannot heal or cure her, but I know God can and will.  Please make this a daily prayer request for her.  It is hard, some days, to stay positive and to not worry about her situation.  I rely on the love of God and the prayers of others to get me through.  God Bless and thank you! #CureMyotonicMuscularDystrophy

Wow..  this song is- a testimony I‚Äôve experienced in a nutshell. Kinda been going through some spiritual battles and depression and walking with a friend through grief process, and his struggle mirrors mine from years ago.  

When my best friend Sunshine passed away in 2011, I had a dream to this day I believe was prophetic in nature.  In 2012, I had a dream where me and Sunshine had gone to a campsite.  We had the tent set up and it was pitch black darkness.  There were oak trees (Isaiah 61)  all around us, and there was a campfire- and I had forgotten a flashlight at the car.  Sunshine asked me directly the question ‚Äòare you prepared?‚Äô 
She waves the flashlight in my face. 
I firmly believe she was telling me to be prepared by reading the Word of God, that the oaks were believers who had gone before, that the Fire  was the Holy Spirit, and the Flashlight was the Word of God, and that her words- to this day- were direct Words from the Lord to be prepared with the Bible in the last day.  
I‚Äôve taken time to understand the scriptures as more than simple reading since then.  It‚Äôs guideposts, it‚Äôs more than devotional and rote reading- it‚Äôs a way of life and answers to questions and needs and often, it‚Äôs not just a single scripture memorization type of book, it‚Äôs important to take the full counsel of God‚Äôs Word.

The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. All praise, worship, glory, and dominion belong to our Holy God forever and ever.
