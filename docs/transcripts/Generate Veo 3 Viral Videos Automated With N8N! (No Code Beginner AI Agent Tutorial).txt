Intro
0:00
up Today I have a very exciting video
0:02
and that is connecting Google's V3 which
0:05
is the best texttovideo model that looks
0:07
super realistic with the best no code
0:10
platform NAD to automate these viral
0:14
videos using an automation in an AI
0:16
agent I highlighted this Instagram page
0:19
called Holy Vlogs which at the time just
0:22
four or five days ago had 30,000
0:24
followers Well if you look here they're
0:26
up a 100,000 followers since I filmed
0:29
that last video Uh for example we have
0:31
this one here 350,000 likes
0:35
here So Mhm The king signed a law
0:38
banning prayer for 30 days Obviously I
0:40
prayed Let's see how that goes All right
0:42
guys It's official They're throwing me
0:44
into the lion's den I'll film what I can
Why its better than ChatGPT
0:47
Dry And if I survive this is going to
0:49
blow up All right Welcome to my crib
0:51
That one's asleep That one's just
0:53
staring at me Honestly they're kind of
0:55
chill but I'm whispering cuz I really
0:57
don't want to wake the angry one Morning
0:58
folks Still here And they are too That
1:01
one's been staring at me since
1:03
sunset Starting to think they like me
1:06
All right made it out Thank God
1:08
Literally if you watch till the end
1:10
comment what you think And hey maybe I
1:12
come back if y'all want part two So
1:14
that's a great example of the type of
1:16
content that's possible with V3 However
1:19
that was a lot of different clips
1:21
stitched together and it would cost a
1:22
lot more to generate Next I'm going to
1:25
show you this Yeti vlog page on Tik Tok
1:28
that's already at 240,000 followers
1:31
Similar to the last page Google VO only
1:34
came out like two weeks ago So they only
1:37
had this amount of posts to get there
1:39
And as you can see just a character
1:41
talking in a very specific vlog like way
1:45
that makes it look real that makes it
1:47
look realistic and does well on social
1:49
media platform
Using Veo3 with Flow
1:51
So quick plug if you want some great
1:53
ideas of viral niches to start and some
1:56
documentation of other people that have
1:58
gotten hundreds of thousands of
1:59
followers using V3 Join my newsletter I
2:02
just started it and my first article is
2:04
going to go over all of that So normally
2:06
to use V3 you'll go to Google's Flow
2:08
product And as you can see right here I
2:11
just generated one This was the caption
2:13
that I used And I actually posted this
2:15
on YouTube shorts I think this was a bad
2:17
idea I should have kept it
2:22
closed So you can see how good this
2:25
looks And all you have to do is type a
2:27
prompt in this box right here And then
2:30
you would have to have a subscription to
2:31
be available I think you can do it now
2:33
on the $20 plan but you don't get a lot
2:35
of credits As you can see we have V3
2:37
selected here uses 100 credits and we
2:40
look at the credit purchase it comes out
2:42
to about $1 worth of credits And that's
2:44
super important because the API model is
2:47
going to be on a different cost system
2:48
and it is going to cost significantly
2:50
more So that's one thing to
2:52
note So one other factor I wanted to go
2:55
over and I covered this in my last video
2:58
but it was creating these VO3 shorts on
3:00
YouTube They're actually monetizable And
3:03
as you can see it made a little bit of
3:05
money on this one I made a few dollars
3:06
here and there on my other post but I
3:08
just wanted to share that So here's the
3:11
NAND layout And what we're doing is
3:13
instead of using the interface of
N8N Automation Overview
3:15
Google's flow we are in the back end
3:18
generating these videos using the same
3:20
technology So some of the advantages for
3:23
this are you can have it you can for
3:25
example put a schedule trigger and have
3:28
it generate a video in the morning every
3:30
day and then you could also link it up
3:33
to your socials to auto post Now it's a
3:36
little bit dangerous doing that cuz you
3:38
probably want to review the actual
3:39
content before you post it uh for a
3:41
obvious reasons but there are a lot of
3:44
more complicated routes you can go This
3:46
automation is extremely simple and it's
3:48
just showing how to call the API to get
3:51
you the video and to put it onto a
3:52
Google sheet Uh but the whole point is
3:55
to do things that are a lot more complex
3:56
to this So I will be expanding it
3:59
However I only ran it one time because
4:01
of the costs and I'll go into the cost
4:03
structure when we get there Uh but this
4:05
is definitely one of those things that's
4:07
more of a proof of concept and once
4:09
either the cost goes down or some better
4:11
models come out which could easily
4:13
happen in the next few weeks things will
4:15
look a lot more promising Okay so I'm
Step by Step N8N Automation
4:17
going to break down this automation for
4:19
you You can do one of two things You can
4:21
either recreate it on your own which I
4:23
highly recommend because learning NADN
4:25
skills are extremely valuable right now
4:27
or two you can just hit these three dots
4:29
and do import from file and I will be
4:32
giving you the template file which will
4:34
have everything and I will point out the
4:36
steps in which you will need to replace
4:38
with your own credentials So the first
4:40
thing we have is a trigger and that's
4:42
just so you can click this uh to start
4:44
the process Now one thing I'm going to
4:46
note is um block right here and this
4:49
create video block I actually
4:50
rightcicked and I clicked pin So what
4:53
pinning does is it takes the initial
4:55
output that is currently loaded in and
4:57
it keeps that the same every single time
5:00
And that's specifically important
5:01
because you don't want to run up a bill
5:04
testing the automation or whatnot You
5:06
only want to run it when you have an
5:08
output that you actually want So if
5:09
you're new to NAN I highly recommend you
5:11
watch some my other videos I'll have the
5:13
top recommendation down in the
5:15
description If not I'll try to make this
5:17
as simple as possible Basically what we
5:19
have right here is just this noode
5:21
diagram where it just goes node to node
5:23
and does your automation It follows
5:25
these little wires in which you can
5:27
unwire and you can wire and then when
5:29
you click on one you have the left side
5:31
which is your input which is everything
5:33
that the out that has been outputed by
5:35
the previous nodes And then you have
5:37
their own output here and what you're
5:40
going to need to do is you're going to
5:41
need to have an open AI account You're
5:43
going to need a replicate account You're
5:44
going to need a Google Sheets account
5:46
and you're basically going to need to
5:48
connect all of those So I'll go really
5:50
quickly um through the nodes and I'll be
5:53
explaining what you need to do if you
5:54
import versus if you're trying to make
5:56
it for the first time So first we have a
5:59
test workflow trigger uh which is the
6:02
easiest one to test on Like I said you
6:04
could replace that with schedule or
6:05
something in the future And then you
6:07
just hit this plus and then you look up
6:08
AI agent and you create this AI agent
6:11
right here And it's pretty simple We
6:13
have the prompt which is just Bible
6:14
character So this is going to make a VO
6:17
prompt based on a Bible character And
6:19
then we have uh we hit this little plus
6:22
right here and then added this open AI
6:24
chat model Once we do that we have um a
6:28
system message which you might have to
6:30
play around a little bit with the
6:31
settings but you're going to want to get
6:32
a system message to appear here And
6:36
you're just going to paste the one I
6:37
have You can create your own too Uh like
6:39
I said this will be included if you if
6:41
you import the template but it's pretty
6:43
simple It's just a paragraph explaining
6:45
the type of video we want It's giving an
6:48
example of one that I did that works
6:50
pretty well And then it's um giving some
6:53
more guidance So then here we have the
6:55
output that it created and that is you
6:57
can zoom in and read it but it's a
6:59
description of a person and what they're
7:01
doing and what they're saying And this
7:03
is a good VO prompt that we're going to
7:04
feed into uh the AI after this So now
7:08
that we have this agent we're going to
7:10
do an add to sheet um a Google Sheets uh
7:14
module And then that is simply going to
7:16
be adding it to a Google sheet so that
7:19
we can track it And then here I have the
7:21
Google sheet So you're going to want to
7:23
recreate this I'll have this linked You
7:25
can just duplicate it but essentially
7:26
it's just a column that says prompt one
7:28
that says status and one that says URL
7:30
Super simple So to add that to the sheet
7:34
you're going to have to connect your
7:35
Google Sheets account You can do that
7:37
with OOTH If you're self-hosted it's
7:39
going to be a little bit more
7:40
complicated but I'll have a link in the
7:41
description if you get stuck here You're
7:43
going to need to do this if you import
7:44
obviously because it's going to be
7:46
modifying your sheet So you're going to
7:48
do appended row which just means add one
7:50
more row And then you're going to have
7:52
to find the sheet and then or the
7:55
document and then the sheet I just left
7:57
it as sheet one And then all we're doing
7:59
is dragging this output from the agent
8:02
into here And then for status we're just
8:05
saying to-do and then the URL doesn't
8:07
matter So all this is doing is is once
8:10
we run it it's adding this line here
8:12
which will say your prompt and then the
8:15
status which will be a to-do until it
8:18
finishes then it switches to done Um and
8:21
then the next one is just pulling from
8:23
the sheet So the reason why I did this
8:25
is you could essentially
8:27
un connect um all these modules by just
8:31
hitting this um to the wire And you
8:33
could just run this over and over again
8:35
create a bunch of prompts and then once
8:38
you have the prompts you like you can
8:40
just delete the other ones And then it
8:42
will one by one when you reconnect it go
8:45
through and build out your the videos in
8:49
the order that you created them or have
8:50
them on the sheet So all this one is
8:52
doing is it's the same thing It's a
8:54
module for getting the idea You're going
8:56
to be doing a get row this time Make
8:59
sure you're connected to the right
9:00
account Same document And then your
9:02
filters are going to be you're going to
9:04
look for the status of to-do So it's
9:06
going to get the first one which status
9:08
is to-do And that's important because if
9:09
you run this a bunch you don't want it
9:11
to recreate the same video you
9:13
previously did cuz that'll waste a lot
9:14
of money And then we just did one more
9:16
thing where you mess around with the
9:18
settings and you do a return only first
9:20
matching row because you only wanted to
9:22
generate one at a time um obviously
9:24
because it's super expensive And then
9:26
once we have that these two steps are
9:28
not required but I just added them in
9:30
for easy management We get to the create
9:33
video step and this is where majority of
9:36
the content is So we're going to be
9:39
using the replicate.com API You can also
9:42
do this on Felai and a bunch of other
9:44
ones And as you can see right here the
9:46
cost is 75 cents per second So this is
9:49
going to cost you $6 for every video
9:52
which is 600% more than going directly
9:55
through Google So that's why I don't
9:56
really recommend you do this I recommend
9:58
you just manually do it through Google
10:00
But because this is a tutorial on
10:02
showing you how to do it through NADN uh
10:05
that's what we're going to need So for
10:06
replicate you're going to need your API
10:08
key That's super important even if
10:10
you're importing it because you're going
10:11
to need to run it through your account
10:13
You're also going to need to connect a
10:14
credit card and I'll show you how to do
10:16
that in a second Um but I'll show you
10:19
how the how the node is set up So this
10:21
is the create video node which is just a
10:24
HTTP request node So that's what you
10:27
would add when you hit the plus Just htt
10:29
HTTP
10:31
request And then you're going to do
10:33
method post You're going to do this URL
10:35
It'll be linked in the document And then
10:38
you're going to need generic credential
10:40
type header off And you're going to need
10:42
to give it authorization as the name And
10:46
you could rename this to replicate here
10:48
cuz you're going to use it in the future
10:50
And then the value is just going to
10:52
bearer space your API key And you're
10:56
going to need to get your API key uh
10:58
through your account on replicate So
11:01
that's important that you put this in
11:03
here cuz if you don't it's just going to
11:04
error out and you need it to be
11:06
connected to your actual account And
11:08
then we're going to be doing sending
11:10
body JSON and then using fields below
11:14
And then the name is
11:16
input.prompt Uh we're all we're doing is
11:18
sending it the prompt And then all I did
11:20
was drag this variable which you can
11:23
just drag into here And that's just
11:26
going to send it this specific prompt
11:28
And it's going to be dynamic based on uh
11:30
each time what it grabs As you can see I
11:33
pinned this So it's not actually going
11:34
to run it again It's just going to
11:36
default to this output And that's
11:38
because obviously each time you run this
11:41
node it will cost you $6 So you really
11:43
don't want to mess this up And I was
11:45
able to do this on one try because I
11:47
pinned it And then we've created the
11:50
video which is pretty much the hard part
11:52
The next thing is we're going to want to
11:54
send it to a wait You don't have to do
11:56
the loop if you don't want but I put it
11:58
on 1 second You're probably going to
12:00
want to put it to something like 30
12:01
seconds and it'll probably take a couple
12:04
minutes I think it took 2 and 1/2
12:06
minutes for this example video Um but
12:09
we're going to just loop through over
12:10
and over again and check it every 30
12:12
seconds until it does finish And once it
12:15
does finish you'll just put it onto your
12:17
sheet and be done So we're going to need
12:20
one more HTTP request module Just going
12:23
to hit the plus there And that's going
12:25
to be get video And what we're going to
12:28
do is on the create video you will have
12:31
a git You're just going to drag that URL
12:34
into here for the URL Then you're going
12:36
to just make sure that you have your
12:38
replicate account And then um it should
12:42
be able to output the video if it's
12:44
outputed It will say s uh status
12:46
succeeded if it did And if it didn't it
12:49
will say something like it's working on
12:50
it So then we have this if loop right
12:53
here And this if loop just has the
12:57
status So we just dragged in the status
12:59
from the last module And then if it's
13:01
equal to succeeded then it moves on If
13:04
not for the false you just loop it back
13:07
to the weight And then for the true we
13:09
loop it back to the final Google sheet
13:11
node The final Google sheet node you
13:13
have to set up the same It's just an
13:15
update row this time Same sheet And then
13:18
what we're doing is we're taking the
13:19
output which is this video file right
13:21
here Just dragging it in to
13:27
um Oh sorry One
13:30
sec So we're just going to be dragging
13:32
that output into the URL section We're
13:36
going to be changing the says to done So
13:37
we're just typing done here And then for
13:39
row number we're just scrolling down to
13:41
the be to the node where we got um the
13:44
thing to generate We're just dragging
13:45
that in here So all that's doing is
13:47
overwriting this row It's now going from
13:50
todo to done And then it's putting the
13:52
video link right there as it shows here
13:55
And then that's the entire automation
13:58
When you run it the agent will come up
14:00
with an idea It'll add it to the sheet
14:02
It will then pull it from the sheet
14:03
These two are not necessary You can just
14:05
cut them out but it is helpful if you
14:07
want to test um your things beforehand
14:10
Then it creates the video and then it
14:12
loops through until it's done and then
14:13
adds it to the sheet So that's the
14:15
entire automation and then I'll show you
14:18
what my sheet looks like So I can just
14:20
open this
14:22
and so I have my Google sheet here and I
14:26
ran it three times One thing to note on
14:28
replicate is it will only last for a
14:30
little while So you're going to need to
14:31
download that quickly I highly recommend
14:34
you do something like a um download for
14:37
that file and then send it through
14:38
Telegram so you have it But this is just
14:40
a basic proof of concept really for
14:42
anyone uh that wants to change it I
14:44
don't really think many people are going
14:46
to be using the automation in the way
14:47
that I set it up Um but once you click
14:51
on this link um before it dies it will
14:54
load this And this is the output that my
14:56
bot generated using the prompt that the
14:59
agent came up with I'm calling down fire
Results
15:02
from heaven to light up the sacrifice
15:09
So you can see that output was pretty
15:11
cool and you could probably string it
15:13
with a few more to create one of those
15:14
Bible uh contents that goes viral So if
Outro
15:18
you made it to this part of the tutorial
15:20
you're definitely going to go far when
15:21
it comes to AI automation However I
15:24
highly recommend that if you want to try
15:26
this strategy and grow a social media
15:28
page that you do it directly through
15:30
Flow because those generations are going
15:32
to cost you significantly less I'm going
15:35
to link the video below where I talk
15:37
about structuring a good prompt where
15:39
you get a good narration and everything
15:40
you need to go viral And I highly
15:43
recommend you do that And then again the
15:46
most important thing of all is coming up
15:48
with a creative idea and theme and
15:50
letting the agent make some cool stuff
15:52
So I'm going to give you some great
