n8n just released a powerful update that lets you use community nodes even if you're hosted on n8n's Cloud, which wasnâ€™t possible before. These community nodes make it much easier to connect to different services without needing to set up complex HTTP requests or worry about authentication. Instead, you get a plug-and-play, no-code interface that saves a ton of time when building automations. 

In this video, I walk you through how to set up community nodes whether you're on n8n Cloud, self-hosted, or running it locally. By the end, you'll know exactly how to start using community nodes to build faster, integrate easier, and save hours in your workflow.

What are Community Nodes?
0:00
if you're tired of setting up manual
0:01
HTTP requests then this is the video for
0:03
you because today I'm going to show you
0:04
guys how to connect to community nodes
0:06
whether you are hosted on Naden cloud
0:08
self-hosted in the cloud or locally
0:10
hosted and a community node is just a
0:12
node that a member of the community has
0:13
built because it solves a specific
0:15
problem or adds more functionality that
0:17
Naden doesn't natively have so let's get
0:19
into it all right so here is an article
0:21
that Naden released last week that says
0:23
community nodes are now available on
0:24
Naden cloud which is great because
0:26
previously you had to be self-hosting
0:28
the community version of NAND if you
0:30
wanted to use these nodes and as you can
0:31
see down here they're starting with just
0:33
25 nodes that are some of the most used
0:35
community-built packages and partner
0:37
supported integrations and they're going
0:39
to be expanding the library gradually
0:41
bringing on more verified nodes so that
0:42
we can connect to pretty much anything a
0:44
lot easier now they talk a little bit
0:46
more about why they're investing in the
0:47
ecosystem community nodes have been
0:48
extremely successful over the past
0:50
couple months and then it's going to
0:51
spotlight a few of the community nodes
0:53
that will be available on cloud like
0:54
tavly pdfge browser flow we've got 11
0:57
labs we've got ser api so let's get into
n8n Hosted Cloud Setup
1:00
our end cloud and check it out one thing
1:02
to note at the top of the article is
1:03
that it says you must be on version 1.94
1:05
or later so if I go into my noden and I
1:08
click on my admin panel in the bottom
1:10
left down here we can see that I'm
1:12
currently running 1.94.1 so I'm good but
1:15
what we have to do is click on settings
1:16
and we have to go down here to verify
1:18
community nodes and turn that on and
1:20
then we have to hit save changes so this
1:22
is going to basically restart our
1:23
workspace so make sure you have your
1:24
workflow saved and everything and if I
1:26
go back to my dashboard it's going to
1:28
say that it's basically spinning it back
1:29
up it's making the changes right now and
1:31
then once it is green we'll be able to
1:34
click open and we'll launch back into
1:35
our Naden environment all right so we're
1:38
green i'm going to go ahead and open up
1:39
my workspace and now that I'm back in my
1:41
environment what we can do is go down
1:42
here to settings and we'll see we have a
1:44
new option down here that says community
1:45
nodes which would not have been there
1:47
before and it says you can install
1:49
community and partner built node
1:50
packages that have been verified by NAN
1:52
directly from the panel so rather than
1:54
having to come here to install it like
1:55
you would if you were self-hosting the
1:57
community edition you can just do it
1:59
straight from the panel so let's hop
2:00
into a workflow and take a look all
2:01
right so here we are in a workflow and
2:03
what I have done is I've connected to
2:05
Tavi using an HTTP request and if you
2:08
guys have been watching my channel for a
2:09
while you've probably seen me connect to
2:10
Tavi a ton it basically lets your agents
2:12
search the web with real-time articles
2:14
that kind of stuff and what we had to do
2:15
inside this HTTP request is we had to go
2:17
to Tavi we had to go to the API
2:19
documentation and we had to set up all
2:21
this stuff with all these different
2:22
parameters as you can see we put in all
2:24
this information we have our parameters
2:25
and what we asked was what is AI
2:27
automation and then here we get our
2:29
actual answer and then over here we get
2:30
a result with an actual URL but what
2:33
we're able to do now with the community
2:34
nodes is if I move this nasty HTTP
2:36
request out of the way and I click on
2:38
the plus if I search for Tavi we can see
2:40
right here that we have a Tavi community
2:42
node and if I hover over the check mark
2:44
it says this is an official node
2:46
maintained by Tavi so I'll click on that
2:48
and what we have to do is install it so
2:50
I'm just going to click install node
2:51
this is going to take like 10 seconds it
2:53
doesn't take long at all now you can see
2:54
that we have it installed if I go into
2:56
the actual community nodes of our cloud
2:58
you can see that this is the one that we
2:59
have this is where you could go ahead
3:00
and look at documentation or uninstall
3:02
this package but now that we have it
3:04
installed what we can do is we can use
3:05
that search endpoint which is exactly
3:07
the one that I used back in this
3:09
previous HTTP request right up here and
3:11
so now it's pretty cool we have a native
3:12
node that has the little Tavi logo and
3:14
everything and all I have to do in here
3:16
is I have to put in a credential and a
3:18
search query and then we have the option
3:19
to add all these other things that we
3:21
had in the actual request right here but
3:23
we don't have to deal with the actual
3:24
body parameter let's say we wanted to um
3:26
you know do a different topic we have
3:29
the option of general news or finance or
3:31
let's say we wanted to do max results we
3:33
can just put in a number and it's way
3:35
more easy to look at so first thing I do
3:38
is I'd want to create a credential so
3:39
I'd click on create a credential and all
3:41
I have to do is plug in my API key so
3:42
I'll go to Tavi and I'll just copy this
3:44
key right here hit save and we'll be
3:46
good to go there and then I just need to
3:48
type in a search term so I'm just going
3:49
to type in what is AI automation just so
3:52
we can see the same thing as what we did
3:53
earlier and now we're running it it is a
3:56
community node as you can see you can
3:58
see we get back this result we don't
3:59
have an answer probably because we did
4:00
different results but we have five
4:02
different URLs and they're all going to
4:04
tell us about what AI automation is and
4:06
what's really nice about these community
4:07
nodes is a lot of times I see people
4:09
have issues with the authentication
4:11
because with Tavi specifically in your
4:13
authentication you have to put in bearer
4:15
space API key but as you guys saw in
4:18
this native node when you create your
4:19
credential all you have to do is give
4:21
your API key so whoever built this
4:22
community node is handling all of that
4:24
kind of stuff on the back end okay okay
4:26
so let's look at one more real quick if
4:28
I go come down here and let's try the 11
4:30
Labs so you can see interact with 11
4:32
Labs API what we have to do of course is
4:34
install it all right there we go so we
4:36
just installed the 11 Labs API and now
4:38
let's see what I want to do is let's do
4:40
convert text to speech so as you can see
4:42
everything's already configured we just
4:43
have to put in a few things so what I'm
4:44
going to do first is my credential so
4:46
all I had to do was paste in my 11 Labs
4:48
API key i didn't have to mess with
4:49
bearer space or X-API- or anything like
4:52
that i just threw in my API key and now
4:54
we're good to go and what I can do is
4:56
choose from a list of voices rather than
4:58
just having to go and get like a voice
4:59
ID so we can see I have Nate Herk I have
5:01
Jarvis I have Archer I have all this
5:02
kind of stuff let's do one with Rachel
5:05
and then the actual text for 11 Labs to
5:07
turn into speech so here we're going to
5:09
have Rachel say community nodes wow
5:11
we'll run this and we'll see what we got
5:13
all right i just downloaded the file
5:14
that I got from 11 Labs let's hear it
5:16
community nodes wow okay so that's just
5:19
to prove that we actually were able to
5:20
access 11 Labs API server and another
Tools & Triggers
5:23
thing I wanted to mention is just
5:24
because it's a community node doesn't
5:25
mean that you can't have triggers or
5:27
agent tools as well so for example if I
5:29
click on the plus under our AI agent
5:31
what we can see is that if I want to do
5:33
the Tavi again but this time use it as a
5:35
tool we see right here we have our
5:36
community tool which is part of that
5:38
Tavly package which of course was this
5:41
one that we just used down here this is
5:43
the official Tavly one and then this is
5:44
the tool that is part of that package
5:46
and so of course I could click under
5:48
there and I could add it to the workflow
5:50
and now we have our Tavly tool that we
5:51
can hook up to our AI agent and we
5:53
already have our credentials saved
5:55
because we just set it up with this
5:56
package and then when it comes to
5:58
triggers you basically would just have
5:59
to play around to see if the community
6:00
node that you're trying to use has a
6:02
trigger so if I came into this workflow
6:04
and I just typed in trigger we can see
6:05
we have a ton of different triggers um
6:07
looks like this one right here Swift Gum
6:08
is one of the official ones that is a
6:10
community node i also noticed earlier
6:12
that we had one called chat data which
6:13
lets you take action in chat data but
6:15
also it can be used as a trigger down
6:17
here so they've got it all okay so now
Self Hosted Setup (Cloud)
6:21
we're in my self-hosted version of Niten
6:23
and I'm going to do the same thing go
6:24
down to settings and click on community
6:26
nodes and like I said now it's a little
6:28
different because we can install
6:29
community nodes straight from here and
6:31
it's super super simple all you do is
6:32
click on install and then you could just
6:33
basically type in the name that you need
6:36
of the package or you could come here
6:37
and click on browse and you could look
6:39
at all these other naden community node
6:41
packages and I'll also include a link to
6:43
this GitHub repo in the description
6:45
which is the top 100 community nodes and
6:47
it has different categories like
6:48
communication and messaging document and
6:51
content generation browser automation
6:52
data processing API and cloud
6:54
integrations this kind of stuff what I'm
6:56
going to do is because we did an example
6:58
with Tableau earlier I'm just going to
6:59
use that exact one that we used but this
7:02
time in a self-hosted environment so I
7:03
would come here I could click on this
7:05
which would take us to the mpm site for
7:08
this actual community node and it's
7:10
really easy all I'm going to have to do
7:11
is go here and copy that go back into
7:14
Naden paste that in there hit the check
7:16
mark and then click install and so now
7:19
we have our Tavi node installed i can go
7:21
back out of here and open up a new
7:23
workflow and so now in this new workflow
7:25
if I come in here and I type in Tavi you
7:27
can see that we're going to have two so
7:29
the first one is the verified one from
7:31
NAN that's maintained by Tavi which is
7:33
the one that we just saw an example of
7:34
we could come in here and we could
7:35
install it or we can see that we have
7:37
this other one that we just installed in
7:39
this little block means that it is a
7:40
community node from a package that we
7:42
installed ourselves and we could click
7:43
in here and we could do the exact same
7:45
thing where we could either search or
Locally Hosted Setup
7:47
extract and then the only difference
7:49
would be if you were running Nadin
7:50
locally you couldn't just come here to
7:52
your settings and go to community nodes
7:54
and install one by typing in the name
7:56
because you need to install the actual
7:58
node package somewhere that your local
8:00
ended can access so according to Naden's
8:02
documentation what you need to do is if
8:04
you want to manually install the
8:05
community node using npm you will have
8:07
to access your docker shell which is you
8:10
just get into your nitn environment
8:12
create a directory for naden nodes if it
8:14
doesn't already exist otherwise just
8:16
navigate to it and then you just have to
8:17
run the npm install command and it will
8:19
already be there so according to the
8:21
tavly node that we just looked at you
8:22
would basically just have to run this
8:23
command and all of the other nodes will
8:25
have the mpm command right there and
8:27
then of course you can go look at the
8:28
GitHub repo for this community node if
8:30
you need some more information and then
8:32
when you restart n it should be there
8:34
when you type into the node panel for
8:36
that node you're looking for all right
8:37
so that is going to do it for this one
8:39
hope you guys enjoyed and hope you get
8:40
in there and play around with some
8:41
community nodes see the value in that if
8:43
you guys want to see a video on some
8:45
automations using different community
8:46
nodes or some of the most useful ones
8:48
let me know i'd love to throw that
8:49
together for you anyways as always I
8:51
appreciate you guys making it to the end
8:52
of the video and I'll see you in the
8:53
next one thanks everyone
