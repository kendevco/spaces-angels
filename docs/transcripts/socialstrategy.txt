The thing with humans is this, we love watching something that is REAL, ALIVE, EMOTIONALLY ENGAGING, can you imagine how people feel when after they are wiping their tears someone says.."you know that wasn't real right, it was AI" You silly, embarrassed and worst of all you feel cheated...

Human here. Any brand trying to use an AI influencer on me I will unfollow. I get that this is the grifter-verse, but why would I buy food from a robot that has never eaten? Go to a vacation spot that a machine has never been? My time and money aren‚Äôt worth much, but it‚Äôs worth enough to actually want a scrap of reality. Some of these tips are creative, others feel like an arms race toward slop. There will be a saturation point where people will just ignore this low effort content we wouldn‚Äôt watch. MLMs and Ponzi schemes are bad enough, what happens when everyone in your downstream are bots? We‚Äôre in a room filling with smoke

Ughhh. This is so depressing. I get it. Things are rapidly changing. I‚Äôm not in denial, I just want to maintain my 1-person grasp on my content creation + self marketing. I don‚Äôt want a team and I don‚Äôt want to learn how to generate more AI slop to stay ahead of the competition. Does that mean I‚Äôm doomed to be drowned out by all the other crap being generated? 

I appreciate your videos, Kalloway. Keep making them. It‚Äôs just too hard to keep up with machine learning.

I‚Äôm all for using AI to help me stay organized, plan better, and solve problems in business and life. But let‚Äôs not ignore the elephant in the room. A lot of people are either losing their jobs to AI or are terrified they‚Äôre next. And that could easily be our customer base. So when they see AI avatars trying to sell to them, it can feel less like innovation and more like manipulation. Like brands are just using tech to mess with people and squeeze money out of them. That kind of energy builds distrust, not connection. Just being real. I love your content Kalloway! Thanks for all you do brother

AI makes humans even more valuable bc people will appreciate real vs fake even more. 

Really good creators will always be in demand no matter what AI can do.

The AI influencer content is soooooo nefarious and scary. It‚Äôs extremely capitalist-focused and is only about number go up. Like. Yea, this will and has been happening, but man it‚Äôs depressing from a human looking for trusted authentic content.

Idk about all this AI BS. I work with brands and make authentic brand content and we sell out as is. Seriously ‚Äî what the fuck is the point of this? You guys are creating content for the sake of creating content and it requires tremendous amounts of effort and manipulation ‚Äî just to create content without soul. I‚Äôm taking this to the grave with me: Authenticity trumps everything. Especially in this AI era, and btw I‚Äôm the 20 yr old who is chronically online and this is my take. People want what‚Äôs real and if you give it to them, it doesn‚Äôt require near as much effort. This is almost sad to me seeing this. You are making content strictly to suck the energy out of people and I‚Äôm not getting behind that. I‚Äôm going to my grave with my authentic content that inspires people and adds value to their life ‚Äî not whatever in the hell clusterfuck this is

While everyone argues over politics and news, The Obscured Principles book by Dorian Caine quietly explains how the real game is played. The moment I read it, everything around me looked different. It‚Äôs like it gave me the decoder ring for reality.

Such a banger episode, just my own thoughts here - I get why big social media companies are probably not creating badges for "real" creators - but, i feel like we are at the point where it's absolutely necessary.

social media is about to change forever
0:02
for brands for creators for anyone
0:04
that's using content to build a business
0:06
we're entering a brand new era now the
0:09
good news is there are a bunch of new
0:10
ways to win that weren't possible before
0:13
i know this because I spend all day on
0:15
the cutting edge of content and
0:17
marketing i have a million followers
0:18
i've done billions of views and I'm
0:20
starting to see trends and patterns that
0:22
are not obvious to the average person
0:24
that are massive opportunities so in
0:26
this video I'm going to walk through the
0:27
eight biggest social media and content
0:29
shifts that I see coming over the next
0:31
few years and I'll break down both the
0:33
strategy and the exact tactics that you
0:35
can use to take advantage right now okay
Shift 1: Social Brand Strategy (From Art Exhibits to TV Networks)
0:38
the first shift is a massive one and
0:40
this is going to impact the social media
0:41
playbook for all brands and creators
0:44
over the next few years this is a shift
0:46
in content strategy from art exhibits to
0:48
TV networks let me explain what I mean
0:50
in the previous era most brands
0:52
approached social media kind of like an
0:54
art exhibit they had their main account
0:56
at Brandname and they posted highly
0:58
curated and aesthetic content mostly
1:00
about their products their customers and
1:02
their world with only onbrand graphics
1:05
and this at Brandname account is their
1:07
primary hero account it's their only
1:09
account and they're also super active on
1:11
secondary social features like Instagram
1:13
stories or DMs they probably have a
1:15
social media coordinator inhouse that
1:17
manages this page but very much behind
1:19
the scenes nobody knows who that creator
1:20
is and that whole umbrella that I just
1:23
described was kind of the core social
1:24
media brand strategy in the previous era
1:27
and by the way many brands are still
1:28
following this art exhibit playbook but
1:30
for the brands on the cutting edge today
1:32
they're doing something completely
1:34
different and this is where I think the
1:35
massive opportunity is i call this the
1:38
TV network's approach to social media
1:40
here's how it works every brand still
1:42
has one front door account at brand name
1:44
for updates and aesthetics but this
1:46
account is actually a head fake it's not
1:49
designed for growth it's just a social
1:51
media landing page with links designed
1:53
for search intent and for DMs the real
1:55
sauce with this new strategy is that
1:57
every brand will also have at least one
2:00
R&D account call it the content
2:02
innovation department of that social
2:04
team and this really is the head of the
2:06
snake for the new age social media
2:08
strategy this R&D account is going to be
2:10
run by a young 20s social native
2:12
terminally online person that is
2:14
studying all the social media formats
2:16
that are working in the brand space and
2:18
adjacent spaces every post on this R&D
2:21
account is intentional and a test zero
2:23
guard rails zero rules now the only goal
2:26
for this account is to find winning
2:27
formulas so what you have as a brand is
2:30
this aesthetic art page churning
2:32
business as usual just fine and then
2:34
under the surface this science-based R&D
2:37
experimental page now when the R&D page
2:40
gets a successful content test to work
2:42
at least three times that format is then
2:44
extracted out and a new channel is
2:47
formed using only that format that
2:49
channel is then added to the overall
2:51
network that new channel is then handed
2:53
to a creator face or a social media
2:55
manager to run it depending on if the
2:56
format is faced or faceless essentially
2:58
it's kind of like a mini incubated media
3:00
startup that is spun out and then run
3:02
separately and most brands will have
3:04
social pods that run these new accounts
3:06
each pod can handle multiple different
3:08
of these secondary accounts i call this
3:09
the TV network strategy because brands
3:12
will start approaching social channels
3:14
like a TV network they'll try a bunch of
3:16
pilots they'll eventually land on a show
3:18
that works they'll greenlight that show
3:20
and then build an entire series or
3:22
channel around it those shows become
3:24
series those series become channels and
3:26
those channels become stations in the TV
3:29
network the big vision is that every
3:31
brand builds their own version of NBC
3:34
ABC but socially native on the platforms
3:36
where their customers spend time now the
3:38
reason this strategy works in the new
3:40
era and couldn't work in the previous
3:42
social era is because we flipped from
3:44
following to for you following only
3:46
showed content to people that already
3:48
followed you so you couldn't run this
3:50
R&D account without it having followers
3:52
you wouldn't be able to get meaningful
3:53
data if you started it from scratch for
3:56
you means the algos will surface good
3:58
content to viewers regardless of how
4:00
many followers you have and this is
4:01
primed for testing new ideas from
4:03
scratch on day one for you also means
4:06
that brands are no longer punished for a
4:08
failed content experiment because if
4:10
something doesn't work it's on a new
4:11
account and their existing followers
4:13
will never see it here's a more detailed
4:14
example to illustrate exactly how this
4:16
would work in practice let's say you run
4:18
a men's personal care brand we'll call
4:20
it Axel you sell soaps shampoos
4:23
deodorant beard stuff things like that
4:25
you have your at@ axle account where you
4:27
post all the aesthetic imagery and the
4:29
products and anytime you launch but if
4:31
you started adding UGC style tests it
4:34
would mess up the feed and the targeting
4:36
would get all over the place so let's
4:37
say you formed this R&D account in
4:39
secret at Lexa Test Lexa's Axel
4:42
backwards so nobody knows and you had
4:44
this absolutely cracked social engineer
4:46
that is running the Lexa Test account
4:48
trying all these different experiments
4:50
that social engineer scans the
4:51
environment and they notice that for
4:53
other beauty brands they have this get
4:56
ready with me format that seems to be
4:57
working where someone's at their
4:59
bathroom mirror talking to it and using
5:01
the products so they start testing those
5:04
formats on the Lexa test account they
5:06
find a more masculine version of the get
5:08
ready with me that seems to be working
5:10
and so they have a validated experiment
5:12
you would then take that get ready with
5:13
me format extract it out of the Lexa
5:15
Test account and create a new secondary
5:17
brand account at Axel Routines and that
5:20
account Axel routines only posts get
5:22
ready with me versions over and over and
5:24
over and over and this is the key you
5:26
don't really care if the Axel routines
5:28
account gets a bunch of followers all
5:30
you're trying to do is get one in five
5:32
videos themselves to pop when those
5:34
videos pop the viewers will click
5:36
through to the link or trickle back to
5:38
the parent account at Axel and you
5:40
repeat this process over and over and
5:41
over the at axle routines will
5:43
eventually build its own little mini
5:45
cult following usually around the
5:47
creator that's posting those get ready
5:48
with me videos the R&D account at lexa
5:51
test after spinning out the get ready
5:53
with me will go back to square one and
5:54
start testing for other formats the goal
5:56
as a brand in the future of social media
5:58
is to have as many verticalized format
6:01
specific accounts as possible under your
6:03
brand umbrella this is what social
6:05
engineering is going to look like in the
6:07
next era and it's all possible because
6:08
of for you algorithms now here's the
6:10
truth there are some brands doing a
6:12
lightweight version of this today with
6:14
UGC creators they pay a 100 UGC creators
6:16
they all make new accounts those
6:18
creators post the winners get cycled
6:20
through they keep the winners those
6:22
accounts kind of fit under the umbrella
6:24
but there's a huge problem with that if
6:25
the UGC creators change course get
6:28
disinterested stop posting content or
6:30
get too big and graduate beyond the comp
6:32
structure you've then lost that vertical
6:34
account that was built instead the
6:36
future is for brands to build their own
6:39
portfolio of owned accounts under the
6:41
umbrella this is where the future of
6:43
social media is going now what are the
6:45
opportunities here cuz I told you I was
6:46
going to talk about the strategy and
6:48
then the click- forclick tactics for how
6:49
to actually take advantage the first
6:51
thing is that brands need to recognize
6:53
this is the apex strategy in the current
6:55
era of social media the winning playbook
6:57
is accepting that reality and then
6:59
hiring for these two roles the first
7:01
role is the social architect this really
7:04
is the maestro of the whole portfolio
7:06
this person can hire train and deploy
7:09
creator content pods against each of the
7:11
channels as they're spun out they're the
7:13
architect the quarterback they manage
7:15
that full portfolio this is really what
7:17
I envision the head of social media role
7:19
will evolve into the second role is the
7:22
social scientist and this is the person
7:24
that is running that R&D pot they are
7:26
deep in the weed scanning all sorts of
7:28
different content ingesting patterns
7:31
they're really good at identifying
7:32
what's working here transposing it and
7:35
testing it for your use case if you have
7:37
those two roles and just two people you
7:39
can scale your business massively with
7:41
free organic content now the other
7:42
opportunity is for young internet native
7:44
creators that want to learn how the
7:46
content game is actually played but they
7:48
want to do it in an organization where
7:50
there are stakes and the conversion can
7:51
actually convert into revenue this is an
7:54
amazing opportunity these roles will be
7:55
extremely lucrative if you're trained on
7:57
the full content stack by the way if
7:59
you're a business owner I think the
8:01
future of content and marketing is the
8:03
number one most important place you
8:04
should be investing your learning time
8:06
because this stuff is changing so fast
8:08
if you want to stay ahead of the curve
8:10
on future of content future of marketing
8:12
then you definitely should be reading my
8:13
free newsletter it goes out to 50,000

Shift 2: AI Influencers
8:22
right social media trend number two
8:23
that's coming in a big way is AI
8:26
influencers and this is a massive
8:28
opportunity for people who go on offense
8:30
now when most people hear AI influencer
8:33
they envision some sort of like pseudo
8:35
human character something like little
8:37
Michaela and if you've never seen
8:39
Michaela before 2.4 million followers
8:41
she or it has a personality but
8:43
immediately to the eye you know it's not
8:45
a human there will be a ton of this type
8:47
of AI character development more like
8:49
Disney style where you're building
8:51
character IP and then franchising around
8:53
and these can do really well but I think
8:55
this is only the tip of what the AI
8:57
influencer iceberg is going to look like
8:59
when I think AI influencers I imagine
9:01
human-like characters and personalities
9:03
that you cannot distinguish from real
9:05
humans like me for example right now
9:08
just kidding i'm not an AI I promise but
9:10
if I wanted to turn myself into an AI
9:12
the technology is nearly ready for me to
9:14
be able to do that using something like
9:16
Hedra or Hey Genen for the avatar 11
9:19
Labs or Hume for the voice the tech is
9:21
very close for you not to be able to
9:23
tell and for me to be able to be an AI
9:25
avatar so this is where things are going
9:27
lookalike indistinguishable human AI
9:30
influencers and I expect social media is
9:32
going to be full of these AI influencer
9:34
accounts they will look human they will
9:36
sound human read like they're human talk
9:38
like they're human and most importantly
9:40
influence culture like they're human so
9:43
here's the opportunity every brand
9:45
should build two types of AI influencers
9:47
and to explain this with an example
9:49
let's imagine you're an accounting firm
9:51
that sells tax software to small
9:54
businesses couldn't have picked a more
9:55
snoozy example but this will give you a
9:57
sense for exactly what to do the first
9:59
AI influencer that every business should
10:01
make is a category evangelist in this
10:04
case let's call him Brian the Tax
10:06
accountant you run the exact same
10:08
creative strategy that the real Brian
10:10
the tax accountant would run but you get
10:12
to fully dial in his look his sound his
10:15
personality his likes his dislikes where
10:17
he's from his story you get to control
10:18
the whole thing because Brian isn't real
10:21
the second type of AI influencer account
10:23
that I would make is the buyer lookalike
10:25
and this one is less obvious
10:26
strategically but this will crush for
10:29
this example you could build Megan the
10:31
small business owner that is struggling
10:33
with her business finances instead of
10:35
just building the solution profile the
10:37
tax accountant you could also build the
10:39
buyer profile the small business owner
10:41
that needs help with their tax
10:42
accounting this will acrue trust of your
10:44
buyer group other small business owners
10:47
which you can then monetize now the
10:48
beauty of AI influencers is that you're
10:50
going to be able to literally print them
10:51
on demand you could have dozens in each
10:53
category and I'd estimate the technology
10:55
is probably four to 6 months away from
10:57
it being game day ready where you really
10:59
can't tell the difference i predict that
11:01
every business is going to have a bunch
11:02
of these AI influencers and those will
11:04
all be separate accounts that also roll
11:07
up to the master network all right
11:08
before we go on just one quick note if
11:10
you're a business owner and this is the
11:12
first time you're hearing about some of
11:13
these concepts you definitely want to
11:14
make sure you're tapped into the future
11:16
of where AI and content is merging this
11:19
intersection AI plus content AI plus
11:22
marketing it's where I'm spending every
11:23
hour of my time because I think this is
11:25
the single biggest lever that you can
11:27
pull to grow your business in the future
11:29
i actually built a free community for
11:31
business owners that has a bunch of
11:33
different trainings about the future of
11:34
content we have over 22,000
11:36
entrepreneurs that are in there all
11:38
helping each other level up their
11:39
content and stay uptodate on what is
11:41
going on it's called Wavy World i've got
11:43
a free invite for you if you want to
Shift 3: The Great Divergence
11:44
join below all right social media shift
11:46
number three is the great divergence and
11:48
this maps to how I think you should play
11:51
social media as AI content starts to
11:53
ramp up like I mentioned if I was
11:55
running a brand I would be printing AI
11:57
influencers to target every single
11:59
customer avatar that I had and as brands
12:02
and individual creators start doing this
12:03
and we start increasing the total amount
12:05
of content that's out there we're going
12:07
to start seeing a convergence towards
12:09
the same winning formats winning formats
12:12
are essentially the visual and story
12:14
structure that are common patterns
12:15
across the content that is working so
12:18
for example if five of the top 10
12:20
fitness accounts are all making the same
12:22
kind of content AI is going to be able
12:24
to pattern match and then those AI
12:25
influencers will also start making that
12:27
type of content and this will create a
12:29
mass convergence where everything on the
12:32
feed looks the same now with every
12:34
action there is an equal and opposite
12:36
reaction and so what this means is that
12:38
once you start seeing this convergence I
12:40
predict there will be a divergence by
12:42
the human actors that are still left
12:44
playing instead of one common format I'm
12:47
talking about wild colors crazy
12:49
structures experiments insane stuff that
12:51
you've never seen because as the AI feed
12:54
converges on one thing human actors will
12:56
have every reason to just start
12:58
experimenting at the edges and this maps
13:00
kind of broadly to the conversation of
13:02
human taste verse generic AI essentially
13:06
all taste is is the ability to be
13:08
different in a way that still resonates
13:10
with people and so I think we're going
13:12
to enter this great divergence an era of
13:14
wild experimentation and crazy stuff
13:16
working because it's the only thing that
13:18
cuts through on the feed an example to
13:20
help explain this would be from Andrew
13:22
Schultz the comedian some may say my
13:24
brother from another mother during the
13:25
pandemic he pioneered a new format where
13:28
he told people to turn their phone and
13:30
that allowed him to deliver his mini
13:32
monologues and sketches a bit better he
13:35
was the first one to ever do that that
13:36
was an example of wild experimentation
13:38
on the edges now imagine that level of
13:40
crazy experimentation times a thousand i
13:43
think that's what we're going to start
13:44
seeing so if you're watching this what
13:45
is the big opportunity for you the
13:47
opportunity if you're a creator or a
13:49
brand is to lean heavy into this
13:51
divergence early crazy formats wild
13:54
colors things that look out of place on
13:56
the feed and this goes handinhand with
13:58
the point I made earlier about TV
14:00
networks as the strategy social R&D
14:02
scientists are going to finally be able
14:04
to go full Rambo and test wild ideas and
14:07
those brands and creators that are the
14:09
earliest to doing this are going to get
14:10
rewarded heavily as the feed starts to
Shift 4: Creator-In-Residence
14:13
converge all right let's move on to
14:14
social media shift number four and for
14:16
this one let's say you don't buy my TV
14:19
network social strategy and you're just
14:20
like "No there's no way brands will only
14:22
ever stick with one account." Well even
14:24
if that ends up being true what they all
14:26
will do is hire this social architect
14:28
role inhouse to completely transform the
14:30
way they attack social media brands are
14:32
starting to wake up to the fact that
14:34
social media is not some reactive
14:36
billboard for aesthetic product shots
14:38
it's their most valuable growth channel
14:40
that can actually be engineered because
14:42
of this big corporations are starting to
14:44
hire creators inhouse and they are
14:46
paying them a ton i call this role
14:48
creator in residence now there are two
14:50
big examples of this I just saw for one
14:52
Starbucks is hiring a global coffee
14:54
creator that will travel all around the
14:55
world and make content and John Deere
14:57
just announced their first ever chief
14:59
tractor officer an in-house creator
15:01
they're paying $175,000 per year and
15:03
this is just the beginning every major
15:06
brand is going to hire young
15:07
20-something creators inhouse and give
15:09
them fullcard blanch to go crazy on
15:11
rebuilding their social strategy from
15:13
the inside they will stop paying
15:15
overpriced social media agencies and
15:16
bring it inhouse all right so what's the
15:18
opportunity here if you're watching
15:20
again if you're an internet native
15:21
ambitious creator this could be your
15:23
dream role to learn the content game on
15:26
someone else's dime while you grow your
15:27
accounts on the side if you want to land
15:29
one of these positions the best way to
15:31
do so is start proactively making
15:32
content on your own channels and then
15:34
tagging the brands that you want to work
15:36
with the other opportunity to take
15:37
advantage of this whole creator and
15:39
residence movement is to do what my
15:40
friend JT Barnett is doing with Creator
15:43
X he essentially runs a recruiting
15:45
agency that helps these brands find
15:47
creator in residences now he has a long
15:50
wait list of clients because he's so
15:51
good but if you want to cut the line
15:53
just go straight to the top and actually
15:54
work with him I have a link here and
15:56
I'll send them over again this
15:57
specifically if you are a brand and want
15:59
to place that in-house creator as your
Shift 5: Long-form Content Formats
16:01
creator and residence all right the
16:03
fifth social media shift is about the
16:04
content funnel and specifically long-
16:06
form content formats the future of
16:08
organic content is really just an
16:10
extended nurture sequence designed to
16:13
get fans to the longest form content
16:15
possible because long- form video is the
16:18
deep waters where you really turn fans
16:20
into forever buyers now creators have
16:23
figured out that the best way to ascend
16:24
fans down that funnel is to use short
16:27
form formats to get them into their
16:28
ecosystem and then slowly nurture them
16:30
into things like YouTube channels
16:32
podcasts and other long- form shows and
16:34
this is so valuable and works because
16:36
the framework around content minutes
16:38
essentially in order to turn a stranger
16:40
into a superfan you need them to consume
16:42
a certain amount of minutes of your
16:43
content long form shows grow that
16:46
minutes total quicker because people
16:47
watch for chunks at a time the TLDDR is
16:50
if you want fans to turn into buyers you
16:52
want them to spend as much time with
16:53
your content as possible brands are just
16:55
starting to come around to the fact that
16:57
this short form to long form ramp is
16:59
optimal and so the non-obvious point
17:01
here is that the long- form content
17:03
format tail is just getting longer and
17:06
longer and what I mean by that is
17:07
formats like live streaming and social
17:09
shopping are really starting to pop it
17:11
is the long tail of the long end of
17:14
content short form YouTube podcast live
17:17
stream social shopping on the far end
17:20
and these are formats where fans have
17:21
the opportunity to interact with their
17:22
favorite brands of creators for hours
17:24
and hours at a time i'm seeing platforms
17:26
like What Not which is social shopping
17:28
in the US that feels straight out of
17:29
Asia do insane numbers and I think we
17:32
haven't even scratched the surface of
17:34
what B2B live streams and B2B social
17:36
shopping really could look like for
17:38
example if you sell B2B SAS to insurance
17:41
companies why not host a live show where
17:43
you bring your clients CEOs of insurance
17:45
companies onto the show to chop it up
17:47
talk about their issues and demo some of
17:49
the products in the industry these
17:51
conversations are typically held behind
17:53
closed doors very stuffy but I think
17:55
once somebody breaks through to this B2B
17:57
live stream space it's going to go gang
17:59
busters again the reason these super
18:01
long- form content formats work so well
18:03
is just the content minute math okay so
18:05
if this is the shift what are the
18:07
tactical opportunities here for brands
18:09
if you're the first to market in either
18:11
of these content formats for your
18:12
category live streaming or social
18:14
shopping you have complete green field
18:16
you can dominate the format and for
18:18
creators that prefer to make content in
18:20
this live longer form way streaming
18:23
social shopping we have not even
18:25
scratched the surface on what
18:26
creatortobrand marketplace looks like
18:28
for those formats there is a huge
18:31
opportunity here on both sides i'm
18:33
telling you don't sleep on these super
18:34
long form formats the brands that
18:36
figured these out they're going to be
Shift 6: Future of Devices
18:37
rewarded handsomely all right social
18:39
media shift number six is about the
18:41
future of devices the actual hardware
18:43
that we consume social media on as
18:45
someone that spends most of my time
18:47
trying to help business owners figure
18:48
out how to win the social media game
18:50
this is something I spend a lot of time
18:52
thinking about today almost everyone is
18:54
consuming video content on a mobile
18:56
phone we all know this but in the next 5
18:58
years I think we're going to see two
19:00
additional hardware mediums emerge in
19:02
addition to the phone and these are
19:04
going to be total opposites of each
19:05
other one of them is going to be AR
19:07
glasses now Meta pioneered this with the
19:09
Meta Ray-B bands google just announced
19:11
their AR glasses i'm sure Apple's going
19:13
to release AR glasses in like 2030 and
19:15
there are tons of independent companies
19:17
trying to crack this AR smart glass
19:19
market as well and basically what AR
19:21
glasses do is create an infinite screen
19:24
when you wear AR glasses the world
19:26
becomes a canvas and the tech in the
19:27
glasses make everything the screen are
19:30
people going to be vertically scrolling
19:31
videos on AR glasses i don't think so so
19:34
the big question is what will be the new
19:36
video medium that emerges for that
19:39
format nobody knows yet exactly because
19:41
we're so early now I mentioned there
19:42
were two new devices that were opposites
19:44
of each other ar glasses are one the
19:46
phone is in the middle what is the other
19:47
one on the other side you've got OpenAI
19:49
teaming up with Johnny IV to create what
19:51
many think is a screenless puck imagine
19:54
a smooth hockey puck with a camera and
19:56
no screen and this sounds like a toy
19:58
that nobody will use but if that thing
20:00
becomes popular and the main way to
20:02
consume with it is audio just via voice
20:04
cuz there's no screen well that will
20:06
completely change the way people have to
20:07
think about making content these are the
20:09
types of things you want to be thinking
20:10
about if you're a business owner looking
20:12
for opportunities both of these devices
20:14
will come to market at mass scale and
20:16
then you're also going to have the phone
20:17
so now business owners are going to have
20:19
to create content for three modalities
20:21
not just one all right so what is the
20:23
tactical play if you buy what I'm saying
20:25
what's the opportunity like with every
20:27
new medium and format the real
20:29
opportunity is for the business owners
20:30
and creators that can be first to play
20:32
and experiment with these things as they
20:34
come out now I'm trying to be one of the
20:36
earliest people to tell you about this
20:38
so in this case there is no immediate
20:40
action because both of those formats are
20:42
not supporting native content yet but
20:44
the opportunity and the action is to
20:46
constantly be monitoring for when those
20:48
come out and then jump on them when they
Shift 7: Future of Product Development
20:50
do okay social media shift number seven
20:52
is actually bigger than all the others
20:54
this is about the future of developing
20:55
products and how social content has a
20:57
role in that and I haven't heard anybody
20:59
talking about this up until now
21:01
companies made physical products using
21:03
this general order of operations first
21:06
they looked at what the market wanted
21:08
then they spent a few weeks going back
21:09
and forth with the factory trying to get
21:11
a sample or prototype made then they try
21:14
to market that initial prototype to see
21:16
if there's any traction then they use
21:18
that feedback to iterate the prototype
21:19
they order the product and then they
21:21
make content and start selling so the
21:23
general flow was mockup to sample
21:25
product to content to revise sample
21:28
product and then to sale and this
21:30
process has a few drawbacks the biggest
21:32
one being the company doesn't actually
21:33
know if the market will buy their
21:35
product while they spend all these weeks
21:37
and months and cost trying to build out
21:39
the sample prototypes well the future of
21:41
product development enabled by AI is
21:43
going to look a little bit different the
21:44
order of operations in the future is
21:46
going to look more like this first the
21:48
companies again will look at the market
21:49
and try to figure out what they want but
21:51
then they'll use AI product development
21:53
software to mock up a product with
21:55
hundreds of variants automatically
21:57
they'll then use AI content to create
22:00
fake models and place those products in
22:02
so they're making content before the
22:04
product is made they'll use the data on
22:06
that content to figure out what people
22:08
actually want then they'll mock up a
22:10
sample and then ultimately sell it so
22:12
the flow becomes mock-ups to content to
22:15
sample product to sale and this sounds
22:17
like a small change but it completely
22:19
inverts the product risk curve for a
22:22
business they don't have to make
22:23
products until they know people will buy
22:25
them and that pre-product validation is
22:27
enabled because of the speed of AI
22:29
product design and AI content i recently
22:31
made a video covering a software that
22:33
does this rapid AI product development
22:34
it's called Virtue 3D and it was pretty
22:36
mind-blowing essentially in just a
22:38
couple days a brand can make hundreds of
22:40
variations and get feedback on those
22:42
through AI content without having to
22:44
spend a single dollar on product and so
22:46
the opportunity for this one is pretty
22:48
clear if you make physical products you
22:50
want to sprint to using these tools
22:52
immediately so you can cut out all the
22:54
time and money risk in the process and
22:56
validate those products first all right
Shift 8: Worldbuilding
22:58
social media and content shift number
23:00
eight is worldbuilding and this is my
23:03
favorite one hands down we're shifting
23:05
from an era of images and videos to an
23:08
era of interactive and immersive worlds
23:10
this demo on the screen came out a
23:11
couple weeks ago from a company called
23:12
4DV out of China it's an innovation in
23:15
video content that uses a technique
23:17
called 4D gauian splatting which
23:19
basically turns any video into a 4D
23:22
immersive experience that a viewer could
23:23
step into and as soon as I saw this I
23:26
realized that the future of the internet
23:27
for creators and brands is going to be
23:29
immersive worldbuing but this isn't
23:32
world building in the traditional sense
23:33
with similar colors and fonts and
23:35
graphic design this is world building
23:37
meaning actual worlds places that fans
23:39
and customers can step inside of and
23:41
immerse themselves in this example from
23:43
4DV renders in the browser you don't
23:46
need any extra hardware no VR glasses
23:48
this is straight on the computer but
23:50
when you think about combining this type
23:51
of technology with those AR glasses the
23:53
world's your oyster now the common
23:55
thread of opportunity is if you're a
23:57
brand or creator it's super valuable to
23:59
be on the edges and have a perspective
24:01
on these types of emerging technologies
24:03
when they come out for a brand and again
24:05
I sound like a broken record you want to
24:07
adopt these early and be one of the
24:08
first people to play with the new
24:10
surface for a creator if you want to
24:12
make a ton of money quickly just go to
24:14
brands that haven't been thinking about
24:16
world building and become a world
24:17
designer where you work with them
24:19
together to create worlds now I'll admit
24:22
a lot of the stuff I mentioned in this
24:23
video were very future forward things
24:25
are starting to bubble but they're not
24:27
all here just yet the strategies like TV
24:30
networks those work right now but some
24:31
of the things like the future of
24:33
hardware the AI puck immersive world
24:36
building we are just scratching the
24:37
surface for what these things might be
24:39
able to be like I said my goal with this
24:40
channel is to both give you explicit
24:43
tactics for how to make your content
24:44
better tomorrow but also paint the
24:47
strategy and vision for where things are
24:48
going so that you have an advantage but
24:50
if you're a fan of my videos you know
24:52
that when we get to the end of the list
24:53
in the title we're never quite done
24:55
there's always some extra points so for
24:57
these last two points I want to talk
24:58
through two tactical explicit strategies
25:01
that you could make tomorrow to improve
25:04
your chances of winning on social media
25:06
and this is in the future these are
25:07
immediate strategies that will work
25:09
right now all right strategy number one
25:10
or shift number nine is the change
25:12
that's happening in earned media and the
25:14
playbook you can run right now to unlock
25:16
tons of free traffic i call this launch
25:19
for coverage the nature of organic
25:21
social media right now is that creators
25:23
see opportunities to cover new stories
25:25
in their category as a way to get a ton
25:27
of views grow their following and
25:29
ultimately monetize so that means lots
25:31
of great creators are looking for crazy
25:34
wild and out there stories that they can
25:36
cover that they know will get traction
25:37
and they will make content on those
25:39
stories for free i do this with Tekken
25:41
AI all the time knowing this as a brand
25:44
your job should be to engineer lowcost
25:46
but high virality stunts that initiate
25:49
this free organic wave this is earned
25:52
media for free to the nth degree now a
25:55
good example of this and one I wanted to
25:56
mention right here is what Dr squatch
25:58
did with Sydney Sweeney dr squatch is a
26:01
men's personal care brand sydney Sweeney
26:02
obviously the famous actor dr squatch
26:04
sold Sydney's bath water in soap bars
26:08
there were 5,000 of them limited edition
26:10
and they sold out immediately but the
26:12
underlying marketing strategy was this
26:14
launch for coverage and they played it
26:16
perfectly the point of them doing this
26:18
wasn't the revenue from those bars and
26:20
it wasn't even about the cost that they
26:22
spent to get Sydney Sweeney what it was
26:24
about is triggering the mob to create
26:27
free earned media free organic content
26:29
about Dr swatch and drive all those
26:32
millions of free impressions to the
26:34
brand hat tip to Horoszi for talking
26:36
about this story this was a brilliant
26:38
marketing example this is what
26:39
freeearned media looks like in this era
26:41
so if you run social media or marketing
26:43
for a brand the opportunity is this you
26:45
should be figuring out what shots on
26:47
goal you can take to rev that freeearned
26:49
media swell and if you do it it could
Tactical Strategy 2: Affiliate Bootcamp
26:52
change your brand overnight all right
26:53
the last tactical suggestion for taking
26:55
advantage of social media is to build an
26:57
affiliate training boot camp affiliate
26:59
marketing has obviously been around for
27:01
a while so that on its own is not new
27:03
but how they typically work is that
27:04
brands make the program affiliates join
27:07
and then those people are on their own
27:09
to figure out how to make content to get
27:10
clicks to drive sales to get that
27:12
affiliate revenue but here's what could
27:14
be innovated there's a massive
27:15
opportunity for brands that know what
27:17
they're doing with content to build
27:19
in-house training programs to train
27:21
those affiliates to make better content
27:24
and drive more conversion the best
27:25
companies should be spending millions to
27:27
educate their affiliates their
27:28
affiliates content performs better
27:30
they're happier they make more and you
27:32
make more so I am about to launch a
27:34
program for this for our affiliates at
27:35
sandcastles.ai for any creators that
27:38
join our program and become an affiliate
27:39
and they post the minimum amount about
27:41
Sandcastles.ai I'm going to offer a free
27:43
training that helps them learn how to
27:45
make better content and this program
27:47
obviously helps us because the affiliate
27:49
revenue for Sandcastles goes up but more
27:51
so it helps the creators because they
27:52
get a skill set that they can monetize
27:54
with every other brand so if you want to
27:56
join this program for Sand Castles and
27:58
you're a creator that actually uses it
28:00

28:02
form and if you're running a brand where
28:03
affiliate marketing matters you should
