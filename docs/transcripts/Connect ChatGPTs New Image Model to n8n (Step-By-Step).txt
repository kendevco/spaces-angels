üëã  ABOUT ME
Hey everyone, my name is Jono. I run a 7-figure service business that offers DJ, photo, video services (#1 largest in Canada), and spent years figuring out how to automate every part of it (and hired the roles that I couldn't). Conservatively, I used to work 80+ hours per week, before sunrise till long after sunset; missing gatherings, family events and everything in between. Through automation though, I was able to replace my job. My goal is to help share what worked for me, in a dream of helping others find true success with their passion.

0:16 Overview
1:27 Build: Generate Image
7:10 Build: Combine Two Images

Intro
0:00
openai just released their newest image
0:02
generation model and take a look for
0:04
yourself at how beautiful these images
0:07
are today we're going to be talking
0:09
about how you can use this image
0:11
generation model straight from within
0:13
NADN to programmatically generate images
Overview
0:16
now there's going to be two particular
0:18
use cases here use case number one is
0:21
how we can generate any of these images
0:23
here and and keep in mind take a look at
0:25
the text as well this is one thing that
0:27
it's really improved on from previous
0:29
models it's the ability they can
0:30
actually write text and it's coherent
0:32
it's not just jumbling random words
0:34
together that make absolutely no sense
0:36
at all and so first of all the text has
0:38
become has gone such a long way and the
0:41
images itself look absolutely stunning
0:43
in my opinion as well and so today we're
0:45
going to be focusing on building out
0:46
these images and then the second use
0:48
case scenario is actually down here
0:50
where we can merge multiple images
0:53
together to generate a final output such
0:56
as like adding in multiple products into
0:58
a gift basket so forget having to go
1:01
into Photoshop or in design or whatever
1:03
and divi design something like this
1:05
quickly you can mock this up in a matter
1:07
of a couple seconds automatically using
1:10
the newest image generation model from
1:12
ChachiBT obviously it's probably not
1:14
going to be as perfect as somebody
1:16
sitting in in design or Photoshop doing
1:18
this but it's going to be a whole lot
1:19
faster so with that being said we're
1:21
going to be talking about how to build
1:22
these out in the next 10 or so minutes
1:25
let's dive into this right now the first
1:26
thing we're going to do is we're going
Build: Generate Image
1:27
to go into OpenAI image generation API
1:31
on Google and we're going to click the
1:32
first link here which is going to take
1:34
me back to the exact page that I was
1:37
just on and so with this page we're
1:40
going to start with the first of three
1:44
different image generation models which
1:46
is just generating an image now just
1:48
before we talk about building this out
1:49
let's go over the next two which was the
1:52
second one was merging images together
1:54
and then the third one was being able to
1:57
essentially add in an image using a mask
2:00
so you can generate if I zoom in here
2:02
you can put in like a mask and be like
2:03
hey do you want to just add in a
2:05
flamingo to this pool because why not
2:07
and then you can go ahead and add in
2:09
that flamingo now we're not going to be
2:11
talking about this third example today
2:12
we're going to be talking about just the
2:14
first two because I didn't feel like it
2:15
was as applicable the third one so let's
2:17
get into this first uh image generation
2:20
prompt first now right away inside this
2:23
we need to hit image API over here and
2:27
then we have this code which is the
2:29
entire code to generate these images
2:32
programmatically using NAD so if you
2:35
come in here it's probably going to
2:37
start with Python code and we need to
2:40
change Python to curl and this contains
2:43
all the information we need to generate
2:45
these images inside NAD we just need to
2:47
hit this copy button here and go into
2:50
NAD now within NAD we can hit the plus
2:53
button here and we're going to type in
2:55
HTTP request now just before we build
2:58
this out I want to explain the
3:00
difference between an HTTP request and
3:02
all of the other modules here which is
3:04
essentially that the NAN team has gone
3:06
in and they've developed all of these
3:08
they've done the integrations for us
3:10
whereas with an HTTP request well you
3:12
have to kind of be the programmer it's
3:13
developed the whole thing yourself and
3:15
so we'll go into this HTTP request and
3:18
there's a lot of technical jargon here
3:20
but the cool thing about it is you have
3:22
this import curl function and you can
3:24
literally just copy exactly what we
3:27
pasted or copied from here into naden
3:30
and it's going to work outside the box
3:32
with the exception of this last line
3:33
here which we need to actually remove
3:36
and so inside naden if we kind of import
3:39
it it's going to draw an error here like
3:41
you can see on the side and so we'll
3:43
just go ahead and delete that last line
3:45
and then it should work out of the box
3:47
so we'll import this in and this will
3:49
generate the image pretty much
3:51
immediately for us couple things are
3:54
it's going to put in a prompt
3:56
automatically for us which says a
3:59
children's book drawing of a
4:01
veterinarian i don't know why I always
4:03
think that this is vegetarian every
4:05
single time I see veterinarian using a
4:07
stethoscope to listen to the heartbeat
4:09
of a baby otter that just like if I had
4:11
to say this like 10 times really really
4:13
fast I would struggle so much with that
4:15
i don't know why that seems so difficult
4:16
to me but anyways we're going to delete
4:18
this and I have this other prompt over
4:19
here and this prompt is creating a
4:21
stunning cinematic wide-angle shot of a
4:24
f futuristic workspace glowing with a
4:26
soft neon light um you can tell I wrote
4:29
this out just kidding i got chatb to
4:31
write that out for me and so that's more
4:34
or less it we could go ahead and test
4:36
this out but be actually before we do we
4:39
need to get this API key we need to do
4:41
two things so first is we need to get an
4:43
API key inside the platform.ai.com
4:46
com website we need to hit a setting the
4:49
settings up top here if you guys haven't
4:51
created an account this would be the
4:52
time where you have to create a free
4:54
account and inside API keys over on the
4:58
sidebar here we can go ahead and create
5:01
a unique key i'm going to call this
5:03
something original like test and I don't
5:06
know why I just I'm I always laugh at my
5:09
own jokes i feel like
5:11
probably less than 2% of people watching
5:13
this laughed at that but um yeah at
5:15
least at least I got a shock out of
5:17
myself okay sweet so we have the API key
5:19
we're going to paste it in here and
5:20
lastly we could execute the step but the
5:23
thing is is that before we actually take
5:24
that step and execute it for whatever
5:27
reason OpenAI has decided that you have
5:30
to verify your identity with them and
5:32
that means you have to upload a driver's
5:33
license because they need to make sure
5:35
that people are not using it for
5:37
malicious intent or in other words
5:39
they're probably actually just trying to
5:41
data farm you and get as much
5:42
information as possible and I tend to
5:45
think it's the latter so just make sure
5:47
to verify or else this will not work
5:48
this is the only downside of working
5:50
with this but once you've gone ahead and
5:51
verified sold off your firstborn child
5:54
and signed away all your rights you can
5:55
go ahead and execute this step here and
5:57
it should work outside of the box and
6:00
this will just take probably like 30
6:02
seconds to go ahead and generate and
6:05
then once it's generated we're pretty
6:07
much good to go for the first use case
6:09
here which is generating images okay and
6:12
we're good to go we can take a look at
6:14
the results here which gave us this base
6:16
uh
6:18
B64_JSON text this is the image we just
6:21
need to convert this into an actual
6:23
image and so how we do that is we're
6:25
going to pin the data up top here
6:26
otherwise it's going to ask us to keep
6:28
running this again to test it and we
6:30
will type in convert over here to a file
6:33
and move base 64 string to a file we can
6:36
drag this in and convert this string
6:38
over here into our image and let's take
6:42
a look at the results cool okay so
6:45
that's pretty interesting and so this is
6:48
just like one example of an image that
6:50
it could generate we can take a look at
6:51
a couple more images that it could
6:53
generate i got this earlier where I
6:55
typed in you know a hyperrealistic otter
6:58
with a orange scarf hug being hugged by
7:00
a cat which I think is really cool and
7:02
if we take a look at some of the past
7:04
images generated in their examples up
7:06
top here these are the other images that
7:08
you can generate as well now moving on
Build: Combine Two Images
7:10
to the second example essentially what
7:12
we want to do is we want to combine two
7:14
images one being this product here and
7:17
another being this product here into a
7:21
gift basket containing the two of them
7:23
and so in other words it may it would
7:26
crop this turn it into a PNG and if
7:28
there was a background other than being
7:30
a white background it would remove you
7:32
know whatever background it is and then
7:34
be able to enter that into a gift basket
7:36
here and so I'm going to go back to the
7:38
original uh the original workflow that I
7:41
created here and this will be down below
7:43
in the description absolutely for free
7:44
if you guys choose to download this but
7:47
in a nutshell how this works is we have
7:50
two Google Drive folders here and this
7:52
was a bit complicated to set up uh it
7:55
seemed a lot more complicated than it
7:57
actually had to be but essentially we
7:58
had two images uh and we needed to
8:01
download them separately inside inside
8:04
uh NAN and then we are merging them
8:07
together so we have two two images
8:09
download both and only once they've both
8:12
been downloaded we merge them together
8:14
and we continue on you'll notice that
8:16
there's two items here which means that
8:18
we have one for the pictures one for
8:20
each picture but we don't want to
8:22
generate two images is we want to
8:24
generate one image with both pictures in
8:26
it and so first of all we need to merge
8:29
both of these together and how we do
8:31
that is through this aggregator and what
8:33
an aggregator does is it will it'll
8:36
essentially take two items or two
8:38
pictures and put it into a list so you
8:40
can think about a list of two images so
8:43
in other words we have one item and this
8:45
should really be called like list or
8:47
whatever but it's one list or one item
8:50
of two images here and one is called
8:53
data and the other is called
8:55
data_1 and then once we were able to
8:58
actually get a list of two images which
9:00
was actually unreasonably hard inside
9:03
NAD um and I had to format it this way
9:06
just to be able to get this to work
9:08
properly then we could use we could we
9:11
could have this HTTP request over here
9:14
to be able to generate these images now
9:18
I'm just going to go back into the
9:19
original setup here and use the the uh
9:23
code that it provided us with for this
9:25
example of editing an image and so we
9:28
just type we just select the image API
9:31
again and make sure that we set this to
9:33
curl and this particular curl request
9:36
here did not import well into NADN so if
9:40
we were to for instance add in another
9:43
HTTP request here and import that curl
9:46
paste it in it's going to give us a
9:48
whole boatload of errors just so so many
9:51
errors and so how I got over this
9:55
problem here was I just copied this into
9:57
chat GPT so I opened it up and I said
10:00
this um curl request is from the uh open
10:06
AI image
10:09
generator can I'm Oops and I don't want
10:13
to actually send that off right now i'm
10:16
trying to import this into NAN but it's
10:21
not working properly can you please
10:24
reformat this curl uh request and make
10:31
it usable in naden and we'll just pass
10:35
that in essentially you just want to
10:37
write out some particular prompt like
10:39
that and it will go ahead and generate
10:41
it or not um and we just have to we just
10:46
have to um essentially follow up with
10:49
this and just say please write me the
10:53
curl
10:55
um so that I can import it into an ADN
10:59
it must be in the format of a curl
11:03
request okay let's see if it gets it
11:05
this
11:08
time sweet so this looks good to me i
11:11
can go ahead and copy that and then
11:13
paste that in here and then it's just
11:15
going to give us all of the code to use
11:17
immediately and again the only thing
11:19
that we need to do is we just need to
11:21
import in the API over here which I've
11:24
gone ahead and done and then the second
11:26
thing is is that we just need to enter
11:28
in our two images now this is kind of
11:30
the body content that it gave us this is
11:33
form data and this is all boiler plate
11:35
but essentially we're defining the image
11:37
model here gpt- image one which is you
11:40
know what we're actually using over here
11:42
this is the image model and then we have
11:44
our particular prompt over here which is
11:47
to generate a photorealistic image of a
11:49
gift basket um and so on and so forth
11:52
even with text and all that kind of
11:54
stuff and then we're passing in the two
11:56
images both of these images are binary
11:59
files and they have the same name which
12:02
is image image with the curly or the
12:04
square braces on top of them and then we
12:06
just have to pass in the orange text on
12:07
both sides and what this is going to do
12:10
is be able to generate this image that
12:13
combines the two into one and I'm just
12:16
going to go ahead and generate this
12:17
image and sweet so as this is just
12:19
wrapping up I'm going to show you the
12:20
first image over here this kind of you
12:23
know is grainy pixelated you almost
12:26
can't even like re you can't really read
12:27
anything that's going on the second one
12:30
is pretty good it's still a bit
12:32
pixelated down here but overall it's
12:34
like somewhat legible and let's take a
12:36
look at the image that it generated over
12:39
here so we'll view this and zoom in so
12:42
first of all I think this is like
12:44
incredible that it seemed to upscale
12:46
this image here like I I mean like let's
12:48
just first of all compare these two
12:50
images side by side this is what it
12:53
started with and then it upscaled it
12:55
into something that absolutely looked
12:56
beautiful and it actually got the text
12:59
mostly right i guess is like maybe your
13:02
brand or something like that shower um
13:06
gel okay yeah it it looks like it
13:08
screwed up that text here but still I
13:11
think the text is better than you know
13:13
this I guess wicked and lush it's pretty
13:15
hard to read but it did a really good
13:17
job and then we have this over here
13:20
dream cream body lotion and then it
13:23
looks like the the uh Yeah that looks
13:26
like another language or just AI
13:28
generated but um yeah so obviously it's
13:31
not perfect with the text yet that is a
13:34
downfall of this but you can see that it
13:36
does say relax and unwind down here and
13:38
it's very good at generating that in my
13:40
opinion and overall super super long way
13:44
that this super far away that this
13:46
technology has come to think that we've
13:48
created a um image generation software
13:51
that's able to merge multiple images
13:53
into a completely uniquely generated
13:56
image in itself i think is super
13:58
freaking cool and so that is it for this
14:01
video guys i think that this technology
14:03
has come a long way if you guys liked
14:05
this video today please do me a favor
14:06
and hit that subscribe button really
14:08
helps me out and if you like content
14:10
like this I'm sure you're going to like
14:12
all the other videos that I publish on a
14:13
weekly basis as well and if you guys
14:15
want to take AI automations to the next
14:17
level highly recommend taking a look at
14:19
my school community over here this is
14:21
mainly to help people accomplish one of
14:23
two goals or two goals firstly it's to
14:26
help people automate their entire
14:27
business and I just give you the exact
14:29
blueprints and and templates and
14:32
everything that I use to scale my
14:33
business and ultimately replace myself
14:35
from it then it's also for people that
14:37
are looking to create an AI automation
14:39
agency give you the exact road map that
14:41
worked for me so that you can just
14:42
bypass all the time and find clients
14:44
close them all of that kind of stuff
14:46
thank you guys so much for watching this
14:48
video hope you have a lovely day and
14:49
I'll see you in the next one bye-bye
