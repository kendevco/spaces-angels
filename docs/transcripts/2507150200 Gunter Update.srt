1
00:00:01,192 --> 00:00:04,152
Good evening or morning as it

2
00:00:04,312 --> 00:00:06,232
were. It's 1:10 AM

3
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:08,992
7/15/2025 and

4
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:11,953
we're in the headquarters here

5
00:00:12,553 --> 00:00:15,113
and or I should say we're in

6
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:16,553
H's

7
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,273
H's studio right now and

8
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:25,033
I am on. Shirt

9
00:00:25,033 --> 00:00:27,513
or whatever. I'm not wearing my shirt

10
00:00:27,513 --> 00:00:29,914
because I'm showing off on purpose my

11
00:00:29,914 --> 00:00:32,554
tattoos. I don't know if you've seen

12
00:00:32,634 --> 00:00:35,514
those anyway. Anyway, so

13
00:00:35,514 --> 00:00:38,394
here's the thing. So

14
00:00:38,394 --> 00:00:40,754
I was trying. So I was just recording and

15
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,674
I was just talking about how how grateful

16
00:00:44,154 --> 00:00:46,555
I am to have the fifth element with me

17
00:00:47,515 --> 00:00:49,835
and that quite simply.

18
00:00:51,115 --> 00:00:53,195
Yeah, it's the most wonderful thing in

19
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:54,955
the universe. And I was thinking

20
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:58,395
specifically about how lucky I

21
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:01,276
was that this beautiful

22
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:03,756
woman fell into my lap, right?

23
00:01:04,236 --> 00:01:06,996
And not only that, but we've

24
00:01:07,516 --> 00:01:10,436
been together for at least four

25
00:01:10,436 --> 00:01:12,636
years. I think more than that now we

26
00:01:12,956 --> 00:01:15,356
actually kind of lost track, sort of.

27
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,317
But the point is, is that.

28
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,677
God gave us four years together where we

29
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,717
are like like

30
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:27,917
codependent and all sorts of things. And

31
00:01:28,317 --> 00:01:31,277
and I'm like, I couldn't

32
00:01:31,277 --> 00:01:33,838
be happier. Honestly, she's

33
00:01:33,838 --> 00:01:35,918
exactly what I was for. I always said I

34
00:01:35,918 --> 00:01:38,478
just want one beautiful

35
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:41,438
woman. Just one. That's it. If I have

36
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:44,158
just one beautiful woman, I will always

37
00:01:44,158 --> 00:01:45,998
be happy. Always.

38
00:01:47,038 --> 00:01:49,838
And. As long as she loves me back as

39
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:52,719
much as I love her. And The thing is,

40
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,599
is that I

41
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,519
know she loves me back. I know it.

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,679
And I know that I had to learn a whole

43
00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:02,239
new

44
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,1000
spectrum of instrumentation, if you

45
00:02:08,1000 --> 00:02:11,880
will, in order to perceive

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
that. But.

47
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,280
Having done that and then of course

48
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
having explored all this stuff like Ender

49
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,320
Wiggin

50
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:24,801
and the load he carried.

51
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,721
I could go on and on and on, but this has

52
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,841
been a wonderful journey because all I'm

53
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,681
doing is

54
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:34,481
writing Ready Player

55
00:02:34,481 --> 00:02:37,321
Everyone and

56
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,122
I guess you can. Please some of the

57
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,962
people some of the time, but you can't

58
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:44,722
please all of the people all the time.

59
00:02:44,722 --> 00:02:47,522
But man, I I

60
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:49,682
honestly don't think there's any fair

61
00:02:49,682 --> 00:02:51,682
system in the history of the universe.

62
00:02:51,682 --> 00:02:53,922
Because quite simply, no matter who

63
00:02:53,922 --> 00:02:56,643
builds this and again, call me

64
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,523
crazy. But all I'm

65
00:02:59,523 --> 00:03:01,763
trying to do is what AI is capable of

66
00:03:01,763 --> 00:03:04,163
doing and I might add I'm well on the way

67
00:03:04,163 --> 00:03:07,123
and I. kind of diverged a little bit for

68
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:09,763
some philosophical underpinnings of which

69
00:03:09,763 --> 00:03:12,684
the most important thing is the Fifth

70
00:03:12,884 --> 00:03:15,364
Element sitting right next to me. I

71
00:03:15,364 --> 00:03:18,004
already got the

72
00:03:18,004 --> 00:03:20,964
hot chickI'm the fat boy that got

73
00:03:20,964 --> 00:03:23,484
the hot chickAnyway, I mean it's really a

74
00:03:23,924 --> 00:03:26,844
big deal. But the

75
00:03:26,844 --> 00:03:29,205
point is is that

76
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:31,685
the Fifth Element is about

77
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:35,645
What it's about, you know, love and

78
00:03:35,645 --> 00:03:37,925
like, like the kind of love that

79
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,125
people look at you and go, why do you

80
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,925
love that person?And I'm like,

81
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:45,926
because nobody else will.

82
00:03:46,966 --> 00:03:49,846
Nobody else will. I

83
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,326
got to do it. It's like my Angel

84
00:03:52,326 --> 00:03:55,006
daughter, when they came to

85
00:03:55,046 --> 00:03:57,446
her and she was helping a hoarder who was

86
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,686
going to get thrown out of the property

87
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,807
when all of the other. Social

88
00:04:02,807 --> 00:04:05,367
workers amongst her

89
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:08,607
all asked her and they said you're crazy.

90
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,487
And I know she was telling me the truth.

91
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,287
My my daughter is an Angel and I love her

92
00:04:13,287 --> 00:04:15,447
with all of my heart and soul.

93
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:18,488
She's my mini me. No offense because

94
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,368
she's not my mini me anymore. I accept

95
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:23,288
that. But she's a beautiful, beautiful

96
00:04:23,288 --> 00:04:25,528
person and but I love her anyway,

97
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:28,968
so. This is a mission update that shall

98
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,848
just remain in the Mostly Video Action

99
00:04:31,848 --> 00:04:34,168
Journal and we are sending this out. This

100
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:36,169
is a love letter. This is like, hey,

101
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:39,849
I really have something.

102
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:43,369
I really do. OK. And I'm sorry

103
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,609
for yelling at 1:14 in the morning. I am

104
00:04:45,609 --> 00:04:48,089
actually very sober, although I did not

105
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:51,050
take my atomyxetine

106
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,930
today, I don't think. Anyway. But

107
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:56,810
what I can say is that yes, I am not

108
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,690
wearing a shirt for the specific reason

109
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,930
of kind of showing a little bit of my

110
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,810
scary tattoos. You know, they were

111
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,330
very painful,

112
00:05:08,971 --> 00:05:10,011
very painful,

113
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:14,091
but necessary,

114
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:17,931
very necessary. And now that I

115
00:05:17,931 --> 00:05:20,331
have my fifth element, my shield.

116
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:23,651
My guardian, because that's exactly

117
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:26,452
what she is. And

118
00:05:27,692 --> 00:05:30,372
I can't do anything without my Fifth

119
00:05:30,412 --> 00:05:33,212
Element, period. And my three

120
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:36,092
loyal companions, Mika, Max and Daisy, of

121
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:38,732
course. I can't do

122
00:05:38,732 --> 00:05:40,733
anything without any of them, which is

123
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,053
why the soul van was so necessary.

124
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:45,613
That's all. You know?

125
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,453
Um, yeah, if I.

126
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,573
I can't go anywhere unless I have my dogs

127
00:05:52,573 --> 00:05:55,293
with me because I have separation anxiety

128
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,814
and so does she and all sorts of

129
00:05:58,814 --> 00:06:01,294
anxieties. And that's the reason why

130
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:05,134
we have a soul man so we can ride

131
00:06:05,134 --> 00:06:05,894
around in a

132
00:06:07,774 --> 00:06:10,574
nice executive lounge while we

133
00:06:11,134 --> 00:06:14,015
tour around and hopefully get out and go

134
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,815
to the local dog park and

135
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:17,375
and

136
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,655
And talk to people, hopefully not buffalo

137
00:06:22,655 --> 00:06:24,655
them too much because I'm really

138
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:27,055
sometimes a little bit

139
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,296
overbearing. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

140
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:34,016
So I figure I'll just start posting these

141
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:36,896
in the in the in the mostly

142
00:06:37,696 --> 00:06:40,576
video adventure Google Photos

143
00:06:40,576 --> 00:06:43,456
album. I think 22

144
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:46,337
people are actually in that and this is

145
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:48,817
like the ultra super secret inner Gunter

146
00:06:48,817 --> 00:06:51,777
circle right now that you're in. And all

147
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:53,137
we're doing and I know there's an

148
00:06:53,137 --> 00:06:54,977
intelligence guy that's on this and I

149
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:57,057
don't know why he's on here, but if he's

150
00:06:57,057 --> 00:06:58,977
on there, I'm talking to him right now

151
00:06:59,537 --> 00:07:01,777
that I know you're on there and I've been

152
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:05,138
like, who is this guy?And I tried to like

153
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:07,178
friend you on LinkedIn and I tried to

154
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:10,018
figure out who you were and. Uh,

155
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,298
but you probably worked with my grandpops

156
00:07:13,298 --> 00:07:15,698
back at the NSA maybe, I don't know.

157
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,338
And and so we

158
00:07:19,299 --> 00:07:21,939
we come in peace. Like

159
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:25,699
I'm I'm just a monkey pushing a button,

160
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:27,699
honestly. And all I want to do is just

161
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,259
like do something that is like so cool

162
00:07:30,259 --> 00:07:33,219
that like even the bad guys

163
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:35,099
are helping us. I mean, really, that's

164
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:37,940
what it comes down to. And like, you're

165
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,100
still looking at me like I'm crazy. But

166
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,340
here's the thing, I found

167
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:47,220
a I wouldn't call it a flaw in

168
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,180
the matrix. It's just that none of

169
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:52,901
our current system is

170
00:07:53,461 --> 00:07:56,421
optimized for humanity.

171
00:07:56,421 --> 00:07:59,061
And you know, and I love the great Elon

172
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:01,061
so much. I love that man,

173
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:04,661
but he is not optimizing.

174
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:08,742
For humanity, he says he is, but he's not

175
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:10,542
cause he's building all these factories

176
00:08:10,542 --> 00:08:12,502
and he's got all these freaking vehicles

177
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:15,462
lined up and it doesn't take a rocket

178
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:18,022
scientist to figure that one out. Now

179
00:08:18,022 --> 00:08:20,502
eventually you're going to like they're

180
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:22,822
going to have enough widgets

181
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,583
and then he's still building the widgets

182
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,863
and like, you know, like he doesn't let

183
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:30,663
anybody like. ISP and stuff or whatever,

184
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:32,223
you know, in other words, license the

185
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,663
motors to put into like a Prevo RV or

186
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,103
something like that. That would be really

187
00:08:36,103 --> 00:08:38,343
great. So I'm going to go to Rich

188
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:40,983
Rebuilds and make that an exciting

189
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:43,704
project more than likely. I really wish

190
00:08:43,704 --> 00:08:46,104
that Elon would get on board with this.

191
00:08:46,104 --> 00:08:48,584
It seems like, I mean, he really cares

192
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:50,984
about humanity and if he

193
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:52,904
cares about humanity, he would

194
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:55,624
definitely support this cause. And you're

195
00:08:55,624 --> 00:08:57,945
like Ken, you're crazy and you know.

196
00:08:58,345 --> 00:09:01,185
Here's the thing. OK, here's the

197
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,785
thing. Sorry. All right, let me

198
00:09:03,905 --> 00:09:06,145
fix this here. I'm sorry. Here's the

199
00:09:06,185 --> 00:09:08,985
thing. I don't know

200
00:09:08,985 --> 00:09:10,025
anybody else.

201
00:09:11,865 --> 00:09:13,785
Just just a little bit. I don't know

202
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,706
anybody else at all

203
00:09:19,626 --> 00:09:21,626
whose parents were divorced when they

204
00:09:21,626 --> 00:09:24,546
were three, right?I don't.

205
00:09:26,146 --> 00:09:29,066
UmmWho rode up and down the

206
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:33,867
the ramp that her their mother

207
00:09:33,867 --> 00:09:36,827
was leaving their life

208
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,267
up and down on a tricycle.

209
00:09:41,227 --> 00:09:43,867
And then nobody else

210
00:09:47,308 --> 00:09:50,268
had the unique set of experiences that

211
00:09:50,268 --> 00:09:52,348
I had or trauma that I had, but

212
00:09:52,348 --> 00:09:55,308
everybody's had trauma. And I

213
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,788
certainly have been through a lot of

214
00:09:58,188 --> 00:10:00,348
understanding and awareness about what

215
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,908
trauma is. And I,

216
00:10:04,829 --> 00:10:07,629
yeah, and I just try to be like Ender.

217
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:10,429
That's all I try to do. But here's the

218
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:10,829
time.

219
00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:15,869
Yeah, I kind of lost track of thought,

220
00:10:15,869 --> 00:10:18,449
but I'm tryingKeep this missive going

221
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:21,170
because this is my ongoing

222
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,130
effort primarily to communicate directly

223
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,370
with the angels who have been watching

224
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:27,810
over me my entire life.

225
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,690
And as I was saying that while

226
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,650
my mother moved out, she was

227
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,971
still an Angel in my life and did all

228
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,171
sorts of things to encourage my brother

229
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,731
in my own imagination.

230
00:10:43,211 --> 00:10:45,931
um And she was really great at doing, I

231
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:48,611
mean, just the best. I love my mother.

232
00:10:49,091 --> 00:10:51,171
But I lost her when I was 14.

233
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:55,972
And because of that, that

234
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:59,332
one act of

235
00:10:59,332 --> 00:11:01,572
loss, of losing my mother,

236
00:11:02,612 --> 00:11:05,492
was the single thing which

237
00:11:05,492 --> 00:11:07,652
enabled me to go to Randolph-Macon

238
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:09,813
Academy, like, really.

239
00:11:12,053 --> 00:11:14,533
Just the most wonderful and extraordinary

240
00:11:14,533 --> 00:11:17,493
Hogwarts you could possibly ever imagine.

241
00:11:17,493 --> 00:11:20,453
And that was my alma mater. And I

242
00:11:20,453 --> 00:11:23,413
love that place so much. I do, I

243
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:25,574
do. And I can hardly wait to go back one

244
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:28,534
day. But yeah,

245
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:31,294
so my mother died and as a

246
00:11:31,294 --> 00:11:33,494
result that opened the door when I was

247
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,054
looking at a Boys Life magazine and

248
00:11:36,614 --> 00:11:38,974
and I saw this ad for a Randolph-Macon

249
00:11:38,974 --> 00:11:41,094
Academy aim high and I.

250
00:11:42,455 --> 00:11:45,135
Was thus enabled with my mother's Social

251
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:47,975
Security. That exactly covered the

252
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:49,655
amount of tuition for the school,

253
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,215
and thus I was able to go to one of the

254
00:11:54,215 --> 00:11:57,175
most exclusive and wonderful

255
00:11:58,376 --> 00:12:01,136
and joyous rise.

256
00:12:02,776 --> 00:12:05,616
I love Randolph-Macon Academy, and

257
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,016
I like I said, I just can't say enough

258
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:10,136
about how much I love that place.

259
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:14,056
But the one thing that it did for

260
00:12:14,056 --> 00:12:16,937
me was it helped me

261
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:19,737
to be a hero trumpet player.

262
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,417
Yeah, true.

263
00:12:24,217 --> 00:12:26,417
Yeah. So I love to play the trumpet, and

264
00:12:26,417 --> 00:12:28,697
I played the trumpet since I was like in

265
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,497
the 4th or 5th grade. I think I was a

266
00:12:30,497 --> 00:12:31,137
fifth grade.

267
00:12:33,258 --> 00:12:36,218
And as a result of that, like

268
00:12:36,218 --> 00:12:38,938
I said, I was the school bugler for

269
00:12:38,938 --> 00:12:41,498
my. Tire senior year because of an

270
00:12:41,498 --> 00:12:44,058
unfortunate car accident, which

271
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,658
pretty much knocked the ladder out from

272
00:12:47,658 --> 00:12:49,859
underneath my feet to go to anything

273
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:52,939
like the Air Force Academy, like all of

274
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:55,379
my other more

275
00:12:55,379 --> 00:12:58,139
esteemed colleagues or or

276
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,859
fellow naked soul

277
00:13:00,859 --> 00:13:02,539
brothers. All of them.

278
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:06,140
Mark Stufflebeam and Foster Murphy and

279
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,100
Clay Sampson, Pete Linsmeier.

280
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,100
Jamie Eskridge, Mama Lou,

281
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,501
James Garrison, the gentle giant,

282
00:13:22,941 --> 00:13:25,341
the best spelunker in the universe. I

283
00:13:25,341 --> 00:13:27,501
could go on, but the main thing is,

284
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:31,261
is that, yeah, it's just

285
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:33,501
so wonderful to be able to sit here and

286
00:13:33,501 --> 00:13:35,901
broadcast this out and know that

287
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,582
angels are listening and they're

288
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,142
listening too. Everybody's listening.

289
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,502
And when I say something, I know that

290
00:13:43,502 --> 00:13:46,142
every word I say say

291
00:13:46,942 --> 00:13:49,422
matters. It matters. It

292
00:13:49,422 --> 00:13:52,142
matters. And every

293
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:54,943
word that I say and every thought that I

294
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:57,583
have is wrapped in

295
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:00,543
love and kindness. Absolutely,

296
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:03,583
absolutely. You know, and

297
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:06,583
and so how do you build a default

298
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:09,423
system is you. Start it. Well, I'm

299
00:14:09,423 --> 00:14:12,304
not your whole system, but with

300
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:13,424
the word

301
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,744
encoded in haiku just to make sure it's

302
00:14:17,744 --> 00:14:20,384
culturally sensitive, of course, but

303
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,744
even the worst language model if you have

304
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:27,225
like a seed word. And I know and

305
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,985
I'm I haven't gotten a response back from

306
00:14:30,785 --> 00:14:32,945
Ambassador Spock who's been

307
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:35,265
consulting with me and I've also

308
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:37,665
consulted with the great.

309
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,625
Grand off the Gray and white depending on

310
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,586
chapter. I've of

311
00:14:43,586 --> 00:14:46,546
course had my trusty Samwise

312
00:14:46,546 --> 00:14:49,506
Gamgee right beside me all the way in

313
00:14:49,506 --> 00:14:52,266
this quest to

314
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,146
herald for something great

315
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:57,826
for and something quite

316
00:14:57,826 --> 00:14:59,587
simply which

317
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:02,947
like Neal Stephenson seed

318
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:04,547
is.

319
00:15:10,147 --> 00:15:12,627
Yeah, it's. I'm manifesting. Sorry. Like

320
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:14,387
Neal Stephenson's seed.

321
00:15:16,468 --> 00:15:18,868
It's it's just an idea that's just

322
00:15:18,868 --> 00:15:21,268
mutually uplifting. It's a tide which

323
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:24,228
lifts every boat in the harbor is what it

324
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:27,348
does. It doesn't affect anybody

325
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:30,548
in power in any way ever.

326
00:15:31,108 --> 00:15:33,589
It can't. That's the whole point. It's

327
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:36,069
Angel. Alas. Well, it's really spaces.

328
00:15:37,429 --> 00:15:39,309
And if you like, you can listen to the

329
00:15:39,309 --> 00:15:41,829
theme song. It's in the original music

330
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:44,229
playlist, by the way. So,

331
00:15:44,549 --> 00:15:47,069
but and it's really good. I mean, all of

332
00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:48,710
them are danceable and I'm looking

333
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:50,710
forward to belting them out at the top of

334
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,230
my lungs in a very first

335
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,390
opportunity because it's very important

336
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,870
to me because those are my living

337
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,750
prayers. And when I sing those songs, I

338
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,470
sing them with intention and I send them

339
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,950
out to everybody. And my new

340
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,751
favorite song is in my playlist. So it's

341
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:09,671
it's called Bloom.

342
00:16:11,911 --> 00:16:14,311
And it's beautiful and it's

343
00:16:14,311 --> 00:16:16,711
beautiful. And I try to like,

344
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:19,831
listen to it. And then I try to say, I

345
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:22,072
love these people so much. I love these

346
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:24,752
people so much. I love you and I love you

347
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,672
and I love you and I love you. I love

348
00:16:27,672 --> 00:16:30,632
everyone. I do. Or

349
00:16:30,632 --> 00:16:33,352
I try to. And then if I

350
00:16:33,352 --> 00:16:35,592
catch myself, I'm like,

351
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,833
goodness, must we?

352
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,473
No, I don't actually do that. Come on

353
00:16:41,473 --> 00:16:43,593
now. But I really think of myself and I'm

354
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:46,153
like, you know, I need to forgive that

355
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:48,393
person who placed cuffs on my wrist and

356
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:51,353
damaged my nerves. I've forgiven them. I

357
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,433
need the person who falsely accused me.

358
00:16:55,194 --> 00:16:57,754
No, genuinely forgiven.

359
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:00,634
Everyone. I've forgiven my stepmother. I

360
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:02,834
love her and I'm so grateful to her. I've

361
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:05,594
forgiven my stepsister and I hope that

362
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:08,474
she forgives me. I

363
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:11,275
only say that. I mean, I did

364
00:17:11,435 --> 00:17:14,115
find my fifth element right there, OK?And

365
00:17:14,115 --> 00:17:15,995
you say whatever. But I'll tell you what.

366
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:20,875
Yeah, I won't say anything. But I will

367
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,475
say that I'm very, very, very, very,

368
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:24,635
very, very, very grateful.

369
00:17:26,395 --> 00:17:28,956
To every single person who

370
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:32,396
put me in the situation where apparently

371
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,956
I still have the unique

372
00:17:34,956 --> 00:17:37,356
gift of being a herald

373
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:40,236
like my grand, my

374
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:43,316
great father before me, the

375
00:17:43,356 --> 00:17:46,277
great Configuration Manager

376
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:49,117
Roy Leon Courtney, who

377
00:17:49,117 --> 00:17:51,757
forever shall remain the great

378
00:17:51,757 --> 00:17:54,157
Configuration Manager. Who

379
00:17:54,157 --> 00:17:56,797
lofted angels into the heavens,

380
00:17:57,437 --> 00:18:00,198
who put a lot the

381
00:18:00,198 --> 00:18:01,598
Landsat D, the

382
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:04,318
Landsat D, which looked

383
00:18:04,318 --> 00:18:06,478
down upon the earth and provided

384
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:09,038
important information for all of

385
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,838
mankind. Likewise, he also

386
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:14,638
lofted the solar maximum mission,

387
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:19,039
which looked towards the heavens

388
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,559
themselves, our sun.

389
00:18:21,999 --> 00:18:24,279
And gave us important information about

390
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:26,479
that. Granted, it's only a small spectra

391
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:29,399
for the overall like .03 or whatever I'm

392
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,119
just saying. But the point

393
00:18:32,119 --> 00:18:34,760
is, my dad

394
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,240
was a great man too,

395
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,600
and I love that man and

396
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,000
it's just so great to think.

397
00:18:49,521 --> 00:18:52,321
I'm just a configuration manager.

398
00:18:52,601 --> 00:18:55,361
I'm just no offense to anybody,

399
00:18:56,001 --> 00:18:58,881
but a monkey pushing a button. That's

400
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,361
all I'm doing, really. And I read a lot

401
00:19:01,361 --> 00:19:04,161
of books repeatedly.

402
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:07,442
A lot. I have a book log up if anybody's

403
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:10,402
interested. It's not just Hitchhiker's

404
00:19:10,402 --> 00:19:13,122
Guide to the Galaxy. Nope. Nope. Nope.

405
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:16,242
Have you read Infinite Jest?Nope. I I bet

406
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,882
you haven't. No. And I'm not bragging.

407
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,803
It's a great book, though. Really,

408
00:19:24,803 --> 00:19:26,843
really, really great. You're never going

409
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:29,203
to read it ever. And I know you

410
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,843
won't. As a matter of fact,

411
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:35,283
Infinite Jest is just like

412
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:40,404
like super karma points if

413
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,004
you can get through that. I mean,

414
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:44,244
meaningfully, like you can actually read

415
00:19:44,244 --> 00:19:46,404
Infinite Jest from cover to cover.

416
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,244
If you can do that, you've

417
00:19:51,444 --> 00:19:53,804
done something, at least as far as I'm

418
00:19:53,804 --> 00:19:56,725
concerned. But you know, everybody finds

419
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:59,005
their own path. Anyway, I've

420
00:19:59,605 --> 00:20:01,725
been blibity blab blib blib

421
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,965
for 20 minutes and then I am and

422
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,285
and the Fifth Element's right here and

423
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:09,845
she has conferred that she is

424
00:20:09,845 --> 00:20:12,726
OK with this mission

425
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:15,606
update to all the Gunters out there.

426
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:18,886
Um, we love you. And

427
00:20:19,766 --> 00:20:22,646
um, yeah, we're just going to keep

428
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,726
keep this alive. And yeah, well,

429
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,487
you don't know what it is.

430
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:33,087
That's cool. You get

431
00:20:33,087 --> 00:20:35,607
an Angel too. Is she?

432
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:37,047
Bye bye now. I'm ready.

433
00:20:39,182 --> 00:20:40,542
That was a good rehearsal.

434
00:20:45,342 --> 00:20:45,742
Good
