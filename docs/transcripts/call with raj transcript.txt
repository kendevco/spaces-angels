All that data is there.
00:04
So client, what is it going to happen?
00:07
It's always now this year the tax filing season starts.
00:15
They need some more, they need information, but all the previous information, whatever is there, they should be able to use that from the previous documents.
00:23
And whatever the client is providing brand new 1090 nines and the brand new W twos, brand new K ones and all that system has to read it and put that information into brand new.
00:41
I can I I can do that for what?
00:44
I mean I can do that in a day or two honestly.
00:47
OK and then for companies, for companies.
00:53
Also they should able to do that.
00:55
That's not only for individuals and well I'm I'm I mean literally actually I mean I can analyze it and I can tell you that whatever the use case is is probably a day or two and I'm not lying to you I would need you but I can I'm gonna take what we so but just to again clarify just to start from beginning there.
01:20
Got this going.
01:21
So one more time.
01:25
You want me to repeat that please.
01:28
So the client that we're talking about, the use case, they have use case is like a is an accounting firm.
01:35
They have existing clientele.
01:41
Their previous taxes have been already been done for the past couple years and those are stored in PDF files I assume.
01:50
Mostly PDF.
01:53
OK, easy.
01:55
OK, keep on going.
01:56
We should be able to extract that data and populate that data into the new current tax filing document along with the brand new information, whatever they have provided this year.
02:13
I can automate that.
02:14
I can make that in about an hour or two, honestly, in two or three days.
02:19
Yeah, those one also have to be more like a gather all information and everything.
02:25
Whatever information is there, they just have to plug it in.
02:30
I'll add numbers and everything inside that.
02:32
I can automate the entire thing.
02:35
Yeah, soup to nuts all the way through.
02:37
Get set, get ready, get set for accountant to review and say that, OK, everything is looking good, everything, all the entries are looking good and the reconciliation is done.
02:50
All that stuff like whatever is there.
02:54
They say that last year they filed $96,000 of a final income tax, but actually they did it a 90,000.
03:02
OK, then they've checked it with the 90,000 with the previous income tax report saying that OK, you filed only 90,000.
03:07
This is the 90,000 number.
03:09
You give it a wrong number this year.
03:11
OK, this is the number like we got it from the previous year.
03:15
We can process each document one by one.
03:18
We can develop, I can develop a workflow that iterates through.
03:23
I would do a custom workflow for this, right?
03:25
I but this would be very straightforward.
03:28
And just to give you an example of something I did in here, give me give me a give me a diagram, a guide wire or visualize visualize the format of the thing and then let me go back to the clients and explain to them and see.
03:43
And if that happens, then probably they'll they'll implement it.
03:47
We'll go ahead and pitch it and we will implement it.
03:50
OK.
03:51
No, I I can do it in a week.
03:52
But I I mean, I'm, I'm not lying to you.
03:55
I'm not.
03:56
I mean so, but just.
03:58
In 30 seconds, a while back I when I was in prison, I took 600 pages of microscopic handwritten journals, right?
04:06
And wrote microscopically because I wanted to to I just not take up a lot of space.
04:12
So but for the longest time I was actually hand typing these out and I got to page 50 in like 60 hours of typing cause I'm like having to use a microscope to look at this right?
04:23
Well, I used Adobe PDF scan and I scanned in all 600 pages in about an hour, right?
04:30
And then I wrote a program with ChatGPT in Python to take all of those PDF, take each PDF file, break it out into images, and then take each image and supply that to an image model and then take the result of that and cash the response back.
04:47
And once I had all of these images analyzed and cashed so I didn't have to pay for it again.
04:53
Because it's very expensive.
04:55
Then I used a separate algorithm that would then take each of.
05:00
Those cash responses to build a narrative and embed each of the images into a document which is like an expounded study guide which includes the original text plus other and contextual notes.
05:15
And it includes navigation and summaries and everything else, all four or 600 pages, meaning however many tax documents there are, I can write an automation that reads.
05:30
In that image and finds it in the database and creates a new entry for this year and forwards everything, applies all the new laws and essentially does everything so that they really don't have to do anything at all.
05:52
OK, get it done and let's work on it.
05:56
All right.
05:56
So yeah, this is, I'm telling you this is gold, man.
05:59
And I am, but the system I have works.
06:02
I'm going to send you a link to it.
06:04
But but I I mean, there's still some minor things that I would need to kind of iron out, but it's it's good enough to demo and all of the major functionality really actually does work.
06:15
It looks up calendar entries, it does deep search and market analysis.
06:20
So it will do a client report for anything.
06:22
So you can set up a very deep research report.
06:25
And ask it for that.
06:26
It will send emails and it as a client portal it well you can say send an e-mail to this client or that client and it'll send it out.
06:35
It is like it's not like it's it is actually having Jarvis from Iron Man at your command and everybody who accesses the system accesses it as them and has similar access to Jarvis.
06:53
It's that simple, but it literally actually can do everything.
06:59
And it takes about an hour or two to develop any integration.
07:03
Period.
07:04
OK.
07:05
OKAll right.
07:07
I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll have something back for you shortly, man.
07:10
It's great talking to you.
07:12
We need to work together because I need money and you need money too.
07:15
And I promise, yeah, there is a lot of opportunity here.
07:19
A lot.
07:20
OK.
07:20
I'll go, man.
07:22
All right.
07:23
Have a great afternoon, Sir.
07:24
Thank you very much for your time.
07:26
Aum santiom.
07:27
OK, I'll get back.
07:29
Bye.
