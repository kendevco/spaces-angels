today I'm reviewing payload CMS and its
0:03
API integration if you're a business
0:06
owner or in Tech being able to integrate
0:09
external services with payload CMS sets
0:12
the stage for great adaptability and
0:22
[Music]
0:25
power I'm Chris with Westside Technology
0:28
Solutions let's see why this is so great
0:32
so first I'll start a little bit with
0:33
payload and its API payload CMS is a
0:36
modern headless CMS designed to give you
0:39
complete control over your content one
0:42
of its most robust features is its
0:44
powerful API which allows you to connect
0:47
your services via API to payload really
0:51
easily this means you can readily
0:53
integrate with other services making
0:55
your content management process
0:57
incredibly efficient the pad CMS API
1:01
offers both rest and graphql options
1:04
giving you flexibility depending on your
1:07
Project's needs rest apis use standard
1:10
HTTP requests to interact with your data
1:13
while graphql allows for more efficient
1:16
data fetching reducing the amount of
1:19
data sent over the network this can be
1:22
especially useful when dealing with
1:24
complex data structures so let's look at
1:27
the API architecture with the rest API
1:30
you'll be working with standard HTTP
1:32
requests in a series of well-defined
1:35
endpoints for example to retrieve user
1:38
data you might use an endpoint like
1:41
API collection slme this provides a
1:44
straightforward way to make requests and
1:46
manage your data and then of course on
1:48
the other side the graphql API offers
1:51
some other unique benefits instead of
1:53
having multiple endpoints like in rest
1:56
you can request exactly the data you
1:58
need with a single query this makes it
2:00
super efficient especially when you're
2:02
fetching nested data or dealing with
2:04
customized queries there's also a local
2:07
API that you can use to fetch data from
2:10
your server um you basically you get the
2:12
same operations available through rest
2:14
API and
2:15
graphql but you're doing this on the
2:18
server so you can use it in your
2:19
templates or endpoints so now I'd like
2:21
to talk about a couple of the benefits
2:23
of using payload cms's API here are
2:25
three of them the first one is
2:27
flexibility and customization you can
2:30
extend almost every aspect of payload
2:33
from creating custom routes to modifying
2:35
the admin user interface adapting it to
2:38
your specific needs next is efficient
2:41
data fetching we already talked about
2:43
this a little bit but using graphql
2:45
enables you to optimize data retrieval
2:47
as much as you can which is particularly
2:50
important in larger and more complex
2:53
applications this can significantly
2:56
enhance performance and user experience
2:58
and finally the third one one the
3:00
payload CMS API facilitates integration
3:03
with external Services it supports
3:05
various plugins and extensions that make
3:07
it easy to connect with other
3:09
applications like stripe or SEO when it
3:12
comes to getting started with
3:14
integrating here are some tips the first
3:17
one is understanding collections
3:19
collections in payload CMS are akin to
3:22
tables in a database they help you
3:24
manage different types of data
3:26
effectively creating and managing
3:28
collections is straightforward allowing
3:31
you to organize your content as you see
3:33
fit collections also get several
3:35
endpoints that can be used for
3:37
integration right out of the box payload
3:40
also comes with a built-in
3:41
authentication system that works
3:43
seamlessly with both rest and graphql
3:46
apis setting up user login log out and
3:50
even password reset is simple and
3:52
intuitive the third tip is customizing
3:54
the admin panel if you want to tailor
3:56
the look and functionality of the admin
3:58
panel you can do that using react
4:00
components this gives you the ability to
4:02
replace default views and introduce your
4:04
own custom components the fifth tip is
4:07
extending payload cms's functionality
4:10
you can use hooks in middleware which
4:12
allow you to integrate custom logic
4:15
making it easy to connect with other
4:17
systems that don't already have plugins
4:18
in place you can even create custom API
4:22
endpoints to enhance the functionality
4:24
tailored to your exact needs and then
4:26
finally the sixth tip is hot reloading
4:28
and typ strip support making use of that
4:31
during development hot reloading can
4:33
save time and headache as it speeds up
4:35
the process plus comprehensive
4:38
typescript support ensures that your
4:40
code is type safe and streamlined
4:43
payload CMS also offers pre-built
4:45
integration with popular Services
4:47
whether it's for cloud storage or
4:49
authentication Solutions these plugins
4:51
can significantly enhance the cms's
4:54
capabilities making it even more
4:56
versatile and easy to work with finally
4:59
always make sure that you're following
5:00
best practices when integrating with
5:03
external Services I may go more in depth
5:06
on this in another video but this
5:08
includes Basics like handling errors
5:10
gracefully and ensuring data consistency
5:13
across the platforms so let's talk just
5:16
a little bit about how to set up rest
5:18
API endpoints in payload CMS first up
5:21
just in case you're watching this and
5:22
you don't already know an endpoint is a
5:25
specific path in your API that allows
5:28
different external services to
5:29
communicate with your payload CMS these
5:32
are really important for customizing the
5:34
functionality of your CMS and enabling
5:37
Integrations like I mentioned earlier
5:39
payload CMS comes with endpoints out of
5:41
the box like the ones here that we
5:43
looked at for the collections but you
5:45
can also add custom endpoints and this
5:47
is where the real magic can happen to
5:50
get started you'll want to ensure
5:51
payload CMS is set up correctly of
5:53
course once that's done you can create
5:56
an array of endpoints in your
5:58
configuration to get started you'll want
6:00
to ensure that payload CMS is set up
6:02
correctly of course and once that's done
6:05
you can create an array of end points in
6:07
your configuration inside of this array
6:10
you'll Define each endpoint's path which
6:12
is essentially the route users will
6:14
access along with its method which
6:17
specifies the type of HTTP requests be
6:20
it get post put or delete and of course
6:24
you'll include a Handler which is the
6:26
function that processes incoming
6:28
requests then once you've configured
6:30
your endpoints it's time to handle the
6:32
requests and responses properly this
6:35
closely resembles how expressjs works if
6:38
you have ever seen that before basically
6:40
you create a Handler function in which
6:42
you write logic to process incoming data
6:45
and send back the response that you want
6:47
to for instance if you're fetching some
6:50
data from your collections you could use
6:52
the local API payload doind to retrieve
6:56
records and then return that data in the
6:59
response
7:00
helping external Services connect API
7:04
for instance if you're fetching some
7:06
data from your collections you could use
7:08
the local API payload doind to retrieve
7:12
the records and then return that data in
7:14
the response helping external Services
7:17
connect via API to payload CMS one of
7:21
the really awesome features that payload
7:23
CMS offers is API keys for
7:26
authentication understanding API Keys is
7:29
crucial because they provide a secure
7:31
and efficient way to connect external
7:34
services and control access and usage to
7:37
your CMS and its data so what is an API
7:40
key exactly API keys are unique
7:44
identifiers that you use to authenticate
7:46
requests from one service to another it
7:49
is a bit different than using username
7:51
and password combinations which might
7:53
require user context API keys are
7:57
actually simpler it's just a string of
7:59
characters basically that you include in
8:02
your requests to validate your identity
8:04
and tell the app who you are to get
8:07
started with API keys in payload CMS
8:09
it's super simple you just need to
8:12
enable API keys in your collections this
8:15
is done by setting the use API key
8:18
property to true in your collection
8:21
configuration once that's enabled you
8:23
can generate individual API keys for
8:25
each user or service directly from a new
8:29
interace in the admin panel and also
8:32
just a quick note when it comes to API
8:33
Keys security is very important make
8:36
sure to manage these Keys properly store
8:39
them safely and avoid putting them in
8:41
places like a public code repository of
8:43
course you also want to limit the access
8:46
to the API Keys based on user roles and
8:49
permissions this ensures that only
8:51
authorized users or Services can make
8:54
requests to your payload CMS
8:56
instance so I'll just quickly review to
8:58
wrap up some some of the best practices
9:00
for successful
9:02
integration of course when integrating
9:04
documentation and testing are your best
9:06
friends thorough documentation of your
9:09
API endpoints data structures and
9:12
authentication methods not only Aid in
9:14
development but also in onboarding new
9:17
team members use tools like Postman or
9:20
insomnia for API testing to make sure
9:22
everything functions smoothly before
9:24
going Live security is also Paramount in
9:27
API integration as well of course always
9:30
use https to encrypt your data in
9:33
transit validate user input to prevent
9:36
potential attacks and remember to secure
9:39
your API Keys like I just mentioned an
9:42
attached and added layer of security is
9:44
using HTTP only cookies which can help
9:48
against cross site scripting attacks
9:51
lastly always consider scalability and
9:54
performance as your application grows
9:57
caching frequently accessed data can
9:59
significantly improve response times
10:02
evaluate your api's capabilities
10:04
regularly to ensure it continues to meet
10:07
your growing needs effectively so to
10:09
wrap up these are some of the things
10:11
that I think make the payload CMS API
10:14
integration capabilities so awesome I'm
10:18
really excited for payload CMS 3.0 to
10:20
come out and start building things more
10:22
and more I really think by leveraging
10:24
payload CMS API Integrations you can
10:27
enhance your content management cap
10:29
capabilities streamline your operations
10:32
and ultimately achieve scalable growth
10:34
while optimizing costs and remember if
10:37
you're looking to build userfriendly
10:39
applications automate part of your
10:41
business processes or need some
