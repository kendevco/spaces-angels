1:16
plus we have teamed up with one of the
1:19
top suppliers to give away a full
1:21
starter kit valued at over $3,000 so
1:23
let's get started with one of the
1:25
fastest growing low-skll high-profit
1:27
businesses out there and that is junk
1:29
removal it doesn't get talked about
1:31
enough but it is an absolute powerhouse
1:34
you do not need a fancy truck you do not
Junk Removal: $300–$800 Per Job with Minimal Gear
1:36
need a team of employees if you've got a
1:38
trailer or you can rent one locally from
1:40
like a U-Haul maybe snag one from
1:43
Facebook Marketplace you're in business
1:45
right most cities have neighborhoods
1:47
with constant moveouts moves in
1:49
cleanouts evictions or hoarders that's a
1:52
little gross but it is what it is and
1:54
they all need somebody to haul all that
1:57
stuff away right startup costs on a
1:59
business like this is usually around
2:01
$1,500 to $3,000 and that's going to get
2:04
you a basic trailer right some straps
2:06
some gloves a few tools and of course
2:08
the dump fees and here's the crazy part
2:11
people will pay $300 to $800 per job
2:14
just to get that junk gone it's
2:16
emotional spending people want it out
2:19
they want their garage back they want
2:21
their yard cleared they want their attic
2:22
cleared out their rental unit ready
2:24
whatever it is and they will pay you to
2:27
make it all disappear i met a guy named
2:29
Kevin who started doing junk removal
2:31
part-time after his regular job uh he
2:33
would book those jobs for Saturday
2:35
morning Saturday afternoon knock them
2:37
out in a few hours and he'd walk away
2:39
with $600 to $900 every single Saturday
2:42
within three months he was booking every
2:45
weekend solid right then he quit his job
2:47
now he has two trailers a helper and a
2:49
Facebook page with over a hundred
2:50
five-star reviews his calendar it stays
2:53
full and he's averaging about $1,000 a
2:55
day in all of those jobs that he's
2:57
booked now here's a little quick tip
2:59
that he told me he said to partner with
3:01
local realtors and property managers
3:03
because they always have cleanout jobs
3:05
and they are willing to pay a premium to
3:07
have someone reliable that they can
3:09
count on to call and get it done and
3:11
once you build your name right it
3:13
snowballs and don't forget people always
3:15
have junk so this is one of those
3:17
businesses that you know it's not going
3:19
to be affected by the economy it's not
3:20
going to be affected by the stock market
3:22
and if this sounds like it's something
3:23

entered to win and tell me what you
3:27

quote IQ ultimate package and if you run
3:34

3:52
so on to the next business that could
3:54
change your life now this one it might
3:56
surprise you but stay with me here
3:58
gravestone cleaning okay it's one of the
Gravestone Cleaning: Underrated & Highly Profitable Niche
4:01
quietest most respectful and honestly
4:03
most fulfilling businesses that you can
4:05
start and the best part is there's not a
4:08
lot of competition right this is a very
4:10
niche service and niche equates to a lot
4:13
of good things the startup cost it's
4:15
easy it's cheap it's under $300 all
4:17
you're going to need is some soft
4:18
bristle brushes a spray bottle some
4:20
gloves a bottle of D2 biological
4:22
solution and that's really it this isn't
4:24
high pressure washing it's gentle detail
4:27
focused work and people are willing to
4:29
pay between $75 to $150 per headstone to
4:33
have uh their loved ones you know places
4:35
of memorial restored uh you don't
4:37
necessarily need a truck you don't need
4:39
any kind of big equipment and this is
4:41
actually pretty easy work right and the
4:43
best part is you aren't going to be
4:45
dealing with a bunch of people and if
4:46
you do happen to run into somebody they
4:48
probably don't want to talk uh so that's
4:51
another added bonus at least in my
4:52
opinion because I don't really like to
4:54
talk to people and look I've got a buddy
4:56
his name is Aaron he lives up in Seattle
4:58
who never could keep a job right pretty
5:00
lazy guy actually and he started a
5:02
gravestone cleaning business as a side
5:04
hustle and he did this after he was he
5:07
actually went out he was cleaning his
5:08
grandmother's plot and he shared a
5:10
before and after photo uh on his
5:12
Facebook page and people started calling
5:14
him and messaging him and now he's got a
5:16
little business that he actually you
5:17
know he cleans stones for families all
5:19
across his area and he started just
5:21
doing it on weekends but now he's doing
5:23
this full-time which surprised everyone
5:26
and now he's built relationships with uh
5:28
the cemeteries around town and he gets
5:30
calls from people like that all the time
5:32
and they're not just wanting one or two
5:33
they're wanting entire rows uh
5:35
maintained right so it's a good little
5:37
business and he turned cleaning his
5:38
grandma's headstone into a really
5:40
profitable business now you don't need a
5:42
storefront you don't need employees and
5:44
you don't need to fight for customers on
5:46
Facebook Marketplace this type of
5:49
business is a little unique in that it
5:51
is a word of mouth mostly right
5:53
missiondriven business that pays well
5:55
and it makes a real impact on people's
5:57
lives plus it fits beautifully into
5:59
other service businesses right if you do
6:02
window cleaning or pressure washing
6:04
something like this gravestone cleaning
6:06
is a great off-season offering or
6:08
something just to fill in you know the
6:10
time that you don't have booked out and
6:12
so one of the biggest things is you
6:14
actually have to take action right you
6:16
have to implement you can't just wait
6:18
around you need to start today it's not
6:20
going to happen because you think about
6:21
it it's going to happen because you do
6:23
it right and there are lots of people
6:24
they just watch videos right they
6:26
comment on videos um and they send me
6:28
emails and DMs and they ask about
6:30
training and coaching and and tips right
6:32
uh because they want to get started but
6:34
they never get started they they they've
6:37
got the information but they can't find
6:39
the motivation they don't have the
6:40
testicular fortitude to step out of
6:42
their comfort zone and actually do
6:44
something rather than talk and think
6:46
about it right so don't be like those
6:48
people because those people are going to
6:49
stay stuck in the same place that
6:51
they're always going to be and that's
6:53
not where we want to be you're here
6:54
watching this video you want something
6:56
better for your life you want to take
6:58
something you want to grow something you
6:59
want to build something okay let's talk
7:01
about something you can build uh the
7:03
next one is something that not a lot of
7:05
people talk about but it can bring in
7:07
really big money and that is parking lot
Parking Lot Striping: $2,000 Jobs, No Competition
7:09
striping i've talked about it before
7:10
because it's such a lowcost entry level
7:13
but the rewards are huge right startup
7:15
costs are about 15 to $3,000 but you can
7:18
get in for like 500 i've done lots of
7:19
videos on it you'll need a striping
7:21
machine that's going to make you more
7:22
efficient some stencils good quality
7:24
paint and the work well painting lines
7:26
and parking lot it sounds boring right
7:28
but here's what is special and this is
7:29
what makes it a little bit different is
7:31
you can charge $500 to $2,000 per job
7:34
depending on the lot size and then the
7:36
property managers HOAs churches every
7:39
business need the service uh for legal
7:41
and safety reasons and it's usually
7:43
budgeted ahead of time meaning once you
7:46
land a contract if you do your part
7:48
you're going to be locked in right and
7:50
this is such an underserved market and
7:52
now is a phenomenal time to get in right
7:55
build your business establish
7:56
relationships get contracts in place and
7:58
you can own your market or at least get
8:00
a substantial chunk of it now we
8:03
actually created a full training program
8:05
called How to Stripe it's over 10 hours
8:08
and it teaches you everything from the
8:10
equipment the setup ADA compliance
8:12
upselling techniques and full on-site
8:14
walkthroughs job walkthroughs how to do
8:17
absolutely everything it's perfect for
8:19
people who have never touched a piece of
8:20
striping equipment in their life and I
8:22
put a link below for that so you can
8:23
check that out now one of our students
8:25
his name is Marcus he started a striping
8:28
business last summer he landed his first
8:30
job with a local shopping center right
8:32
got out there knocks on some doors boots
8:35
on the ground and guess what they paid
8:36
him $1,300 for a single night's work now
8:39
he's striping warehouse lots he's doing
8:41
school parking lots even handicap stall
8:43
renewals on a quarterly contract for a
8:46
rather large really good chicken place
8:48
and he's on track to break six figures
8:50
this year and he just started last
8:52
summer it's unbelievable so go ahead
8:54
like this video if you've ever thought
8:56
about quitting your job and doing
8:58
something on your own which brings us
9:00
into the next one and this is a classic
9:03
this has been around forever but it's
9:05
window cleaning right and it's simple
9:07
it's straightforward and the good thing
Window Cleaning: $1,200 a Day with Route Work
9:09
it's scalable you can start with less
9:11
than $500 right a squeegee some
9:14
scrubbers and a ladder but if you really
9:16
want to take it to the next level this
9:18
is the one that I was telling you about
9:19
so pay attention because you're going to
9:21
want to hear this great business to get
9:22
into and we've partnered with the Window
9:24
Cleaning Resource they're the best as
9:26
far as equipment and supplies for that
9:28
industry quote IQ and the Window
9:29
Cleaning Resource have teamed up to give
9:31
away a full Pure Water system starter
9:33
kit as well as a waterfed pole all by
9:36
Pure Water Power great company that
9:38
system alone can make you stand out in
9:40
your area instantly make you more
9:41
efficient more profitable and give you
9:43
the ability to tackle big jobs from day
9:45
one and then you can grow from there so
9:47
here's how it works most residential
9:49
jobs pay between $150 to $400 depending
9:52
on the house depending on the size
9:54
depending on the intricacy the windows
9:56
all of those things whether you're doing
9:57
the inside whether you're doing the
9:58
outside it can just keep going up right
10:00
storefronts $50 to $100 per stop and if
10:03
you build a route then you've got weekly
10:05
or monthly recurring income right a guy
10:07
named Brian I know I met him at a local
10:09
business event and he built a window
10:12
cleaning business purely commercial 40
10:14
businesses uh he was able to lock down
10:16
in like 60 days right two months and he
10:18
was able to quit his full-time job after
10:20
a couple months and now he's doing it
10:22
full-time making between $900 to $1,200
10:24
a day on average between the storefronts
10:27
and the residential stuff that he's
10:28
doing window cleaning is a great uh
10:31
business to get into because it's fast
10:33
it's clean and the results are instant
10:35
right people love sparkling glass and if
10:37
you add in screens you're doing tracks
10:40
hard water stain removal you can bump
10:41
every job by 50 to 100 $200 with a
10:45
little extra time a little extra work
10:47
but a lot of extra money because window
10:49
cleaning is one of those businesses
10:51
where word of mouth really does play a
10:53
huge part in growth especially in the
10:55
residential window cleaning world do
10:56
good work get lots of reviews use the
10:59
review multiplier and quote IQ that
11:01
increases reviews by 78% and also always
11:04
ask for referrals if you're not asking
11:06
for reviews if you're not asking
11:08
referrals you're wrong and you're going
11:09
to be surprised how fast you can grow
11:11
when you do do these things okay and now
11:13
let's talk about where I started right
11:16
the one business that changed absolutely
11:18
everything for me and my family and that
11:20
is pressure washing right this is a
Clean Money Services: Pressure Washing, Soft Washing, Trash Bin Cleaning
11:22
great business highly scalable highly
11:25
profitable startup costs are minimal
11:27
around a,000 to $3,000 depending on how
11:29
you build your first setup but the
11:31
potential like I said is absolutely
11:33
massive right you can make $300 to $500
11:36
easily per pressure washing job
11:39
driveways patios decks houses sidings
11:42
roofs right and it can go way up $1,200
11:44
$1,500 $2,000 for one property you add
11:48
in soft washing which uses a low
11:49
pressure system and cleaning solutions
11:51
you start doing roofs right that's huge
11:53
money and then fences other delicate
11:55
surfaces specialty chemicals all of
11:57
these things are absolutely phenomenal
11:59
and the best part it's all the same
12:01
equipment with just a few little add-ons
12:03
a pressure washer a soft wash system
12:06
these are the things that you need right
12:07
get a window cleaning system just like
12:09
the one we're giving away from the WCR
12:11
and there are a lot of add-on services
12:13
little niches that you can get into and
12:16
one that is again kind of underserved is
12:18
trash bin cleaning right it's kind of
12:21
gross but it's gold right hoas
12:23
neighborhoods even commercial properties
12:25
they're going to pay for this homeowners
12:27
are going to pay for this and because
12:28
it's on a monthly route that is that
12:31
recurring revenue that recurring income
12:33
that is absolutely critical and crucial
12:35
for service businesses and there are all
12:38
kinds of these little specialty niche
12:39
type services that you can add on i had
12:41
a buddy who just started a pressure
12:43
washing business all he had was a
12:45
pressure washer and a couple flyers
12:46
right he was able to book three
12:48
driveways his first weekend he made
12:50
$1,100 right he never looked back uh six
12:53
months later he got his truck wrapped he
12:55
got a new trailer he had a bunch of
12:57
Google reviews because he's doing the
12:58
things that he needs to do and he's
13:00
talking about hiring a helper which but
13:02
whatever but the key is simple right
13:05
start with one service that fits your
13:06
area best in some markets it's all about
13:09
roofs and others driveways sidewalks
13:11
depending on where you're at uh maybe
13:13
your city has a ton of HOAs with strict
13:15
bin rules or uh strict regulations on
13:18
the the cleanliness of the homes figure
Bonus Business
13:20
out what's in demand and go all in and
13:22
then scale sideways with the same gear
13:25
with the right knowledge the right
13:26
education the right equipment you will
13:28
be able to scale fast if you're
13:30
interested we've got how to wash two it
13:32
teaches everything that you need to know
13:33
about both commercial and residential
13:35
pressure cleaning softwashing the
13:37
equipment we do job walkthroughs safety
13:40
everything that you need it's right
13:41
there i think it's about eight and a
13:42
half hours long but it's phenomenal half
13:44
price right now i'll leave a link down
13:46
below so you can check it out now let's
13:48
talk about a business model where you
13:51
don't need any equipment you do not need
13:53
any experience you just need to know how
13:55
to generate leads and negotiate and sell
13:59
and that is with a remote service
14:01
business okay this is where you generate
14:04
and you sell leads for a commission but
14:06
the type of model I'm talking about here
14:07
is different than what most people think
14:08
about like the scammers over at Angie's
14:10
who sell the same lead 10 times or these
14:13
guys that you get emails and texts and
14:14
you see them pop up on your feed that
14:16
claim to get you business for free right
14:18
well I found a guy who developed an
14:20
entire strategy to basically take over a
14:22
niche in any market build a lead
14:25
generating machine and then partner up
14:26
