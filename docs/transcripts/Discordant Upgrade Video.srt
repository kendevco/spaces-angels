1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,920
Hello, this is

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,160
Ken and I'm going over my

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,800
Discord clone slash Discordant

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,480
AI robot everything tool.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,240
And what we're looking at right now is a

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
sign in and we have two separate pages

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,040
that are signing in here. And

8
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,400
so we're going to go ahead and sign in as

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,080
me

10
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,080
and then once as.

11
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,000
My partner.

12
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:38,900
I go to my homepage, which is my home

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,460
server is called kendev and you can see

14
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,100
that I have all these people who are

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,180
members of my server here.

16
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:50,180
And you can see that I've been busy

17
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,300
on this today.

18
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,420
Uh I've been running tests and stuff for

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,280
quite a while. Is what this is,

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,080
is whenever I post a message or you post

21
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,440
a message or

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,240
anybody posts a message to this, it goes

23
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,960
through the

24
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,760
nation back end. And

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,760
So what that nation is,

26
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,120
is N aid in. I call it nation. They don't

27
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,800
even call it nation. I don't know why I

28
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,040
do, but I do. I just think it sounds like

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
it and we can see right here.

30
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,040
anytime I send a message

31
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,480
into the server

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,760
like the one I just sent to

33
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,800
add Max's appointment next week

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,480
a party at sunset point after dog park

35
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,440
after 6 p.m. so it added

36
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,080
it in here and then it

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,880
created the event right here and I'm

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,360
still working on formatting that but

39
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,440
We go right here. Let's see if we get

40
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
that event.

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,280
Yep, party at sunset point

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
at 6:00 PM after Max's appointment.

43
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,800
So what we've got here right now

44
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,440
is a working

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,880
system where

46
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,720
I have every message that comes

47
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,280
into this server, which also

48
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,040
coincidentally is a.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,640
Uh, multi-user.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,000
I have an issue with running multiple

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,880
cameras right now. I don't know why. Um,

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,440
uh, let me deactivate.

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,600
There it goes. OK, so now

54
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,880
we have this and I can also get in here

55
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,240
and. Share my screen

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,600
or whatever. And then so

57
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,800
right now I'm in the video channel here.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,240
I won't be able to do that,

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
but I can go to the video channel here

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,680
and I'm in my Code with Kenda

61
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
video channel and you can

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,640
see me

63
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,200
right there and this will work.

64
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,840
And number of users. So anybody who's

65
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,240
into this channel and this little

66
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,960
conference like Teams,

67
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,760
when you enter a channel, it should be

68
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
talking about a message in here that was

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,720
searchable.

70
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:51,220
And as you can see, so I was at the

71
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,460
Enterprise dog park and I just uploaded

72
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,820
this and I was there.

73
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,940
This could create an ongoing journal or

74
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,860
whatever into that workflow.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
And again, that workflow can recurse back

76
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
into this. So when we look at theworkflow,

77
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,720
my workflow actually has a tool

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,080
to get the messages from the database. So

79
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,760
this is actually loading uh

80
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,160
the last 20 messages from the channel

81
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,960
whenever a request comes in. So this is

82
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,880
very performant. So and then the other

83
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
thing is, is that we're going to be

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,720
building this into a custom query tool.

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
So what'll happen is, is when you when

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,240
you perform any search in here,

87
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,840
like for example.

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,200
Right here, we just asked for a GSA

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,640
analysis and now we're looking at our our

90
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,320
workflow coming in here,

91
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,440
right?And we can see

92
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,520
that it's hit our workflow. We don't see

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,440
any of the animations that are happening.

94
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
If this was running in test mode, you

95
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,360
could actually see these nodes animating

96
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,840
as they execute. It's really fun to

97
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,400
watch.

98
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,320
Yeah.

99
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,320
So this is a report and this

100
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,040
this is so if you're like working on a

101
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,920
prospect and I want to know

102
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,920
about Gulf Coast aluminum products, this

103
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,000
will actually go out and do

104
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,080
a pretty cool report

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,640
giving you all of the various GSA

106
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,520
schedules and value

107
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,840
propositions and things like that for the

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,440
customer. Can go out and

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,240
actually research the Business of the company

110
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,320
or who the best contact is,

111
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,680
if they have any contracts or already

112
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,640
pretty much anything. And right now

113
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,040
what we're looking at is the actual flow

114
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,000
that is implemented right now.

115
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,760
So I get the latest messages here.

116
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
I have a few calendar events. I can

117
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,200
connect this to any Google Calendar or

118
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,000
also up to Sugar CRM, for example.

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,040
Um And then this is my calendar with all

120
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,720
of these different events that I've been

121
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,880
managing with my

122
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,640
site AI. So really there

123
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,080
isn't anything that can't be done with

124
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
this. When you submit a uh

125
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,280
A picture into

126
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,080
it, you know

127
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,320
OK, so that still pops in. That's a

128
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,400
little is minor,

129
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,640
but you get the picture,

130
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,240
sort of.

131
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,840
But what we can do is use this as the

132
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,960
foundation for a complete business

133
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,800
intelligence system, because every

134
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,160
message becomes part of the retrieval

135
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,480
augmented storage system, otherwise known

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,000
as retrieval augmented,

137
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,160
right?So anyway, each of

138
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,480
these messages have an internal Jason

139
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,040
structure that enables them to store

140
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,000
anything and then be queried

141
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,240
on that intelligently with Jason.

142
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,840
Syntax, if you will. But this

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,320
is very handy already. And also note

144
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,120
things like a report comes

145
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,000
back. It's long. It just shows you enough

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,720
to wet your whistle so you know what it

147
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,960
is. And then you can expand it out. Show

148
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,880
more 32 lines here

149
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,320
and we can. OK, that's good. And

150
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,960
now we'll be able to search and maybe

151
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,760
we'll have a separate search up here that

152
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,120
you could filter messages by whatever. I

153
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,880
think you need to have that. But with the

154
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,080
intelligent search, what this does is

155
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,080
this actually has access to all the

156
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,320
messages that you have permission on.

157
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,280
So all the messages in all the different

158
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,240
servers you have permissions on

159
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,840
this does. So this is

160
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,320
very powerful and

161
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,120
and again we go into our

162
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,000
workflow editor here. I can add an

163
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,960
e-mail. I want to add

164
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,640
a e-mail, send

165
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,480
mail. I can add a Gmail though. Boom

166
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,080
uh get many messages so I can I can

167
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,960
create a whole e-mail agent that

168
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,440
all it does is I could be in there and

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,080
say send a e-mail to him and then have an

170
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,960
e-mail agent on here that drafts a really

171
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,520
nice e-mail showing exactly how.

172
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
This can benefit that particular client

173
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,800
and then it can record it in the CRM

174
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,400
and because I can link in to Sugar.

175
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,320
So if I add Sugar,

176
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
so we have Zoho Agile CRM

177
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,960
and if we don't have a CRM it doesn't

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,600
matter because these code nodes are

179
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,800
incredibly sophisticated. Just so you

180
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,280
know, these things are like.

181
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,640
Crazy sophisticated and

182
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,360
the model just whips him out in a

183
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
heartbeat. And that's the part I'm not

184
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,080
the secret sauce. I'm not showing how I

185
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,560
built it. You don't need to know that

186
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,760
anyhow, but I do have a very

187
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
rapid and effective workflow. So anytime

188
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
you want to change your business logic or

189
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,520
add something new, I want to. Now

190
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,720
I want to be able to update contact

191
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
records. I just go ahead and plop that

192
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,920
tool right on to the agent right here

193
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,360
and we can get more sophisticated. This

194
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,200
this is just from a day's well two days

195
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,040
worth of tinkering that I have a general

196
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,600
services AI which can schedule

197
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,400
events, any kind of

198
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,480
event and it can also.

199
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,200
In addition, it can also do the research,

200
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,120
which I'm still working on this tool, but

201
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,440
this tool right here, just to give a

202
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,840
little perspective,

203
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,400
is also

204
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,360
183 lines of code.

205
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,040
So and what this tool is doing is

206
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,840
actually going out to or will be

207
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,400
going out to Google using a

208
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,120
custom search API to go

209
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,920
get. Information about that company,

210
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,280
return that, take all of that and put

211
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,480
that into that nice pretty report about

212
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,640
the company and then that becomes

213
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,560
searchable by anybody and it's

214
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,280
instantaneously. So now you have all of

215
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,160
that information and we can go way deeper

216
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,720
than that surface. I have

217
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,760
looked at other workflows which are

218
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,720
that just make this look like child's

219
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,640
play, but the great thing is, is that.

220
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,280
This system supports that right

221
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,160
out-of-the-box, so I can increase these

222
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,480
workflows. These nation open source

223
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,760
free to run workflows are very

224
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,440
inexpensive. I mean, you can self host or

225
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,240
I can host it for you, or I can set up an

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,920
identical copy of my hosting environment,

227
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,440
which while we're at it is a

228
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,280
Windows Server. And

229
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,680
I also host things like Uptime Kuma,

230
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,560
which is an uptime monitoring tool. to

231
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,680
ensure that all the services are running

232
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,320
properly. And I also

233
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:02,800
have...

234
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,810
Gotta run it slow here.

235
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,830
Alright, slower molasses going uphill on

236
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,950
a cold day in January in

237
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:30,150
Alaska.

238
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,470
Oh, here's Uptime Kuma.

239
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,840
OK, my memory resources are dragging on

240
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,000
the server. It's must be,

241
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,400
but you get the picture. So what we have

242
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,960
here is a system which say for

243
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,160
example, like I said, I come in here and

244
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,280
I put in my mileage. Now it's a mileage

245
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,520
log or if I put in this

246
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,560
this customer and I want to look it up,

247
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,680
it will record that customer into the

248
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,520
CRM. And update it saying that we

249
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,080
researched it. So now we'll put a CRM

250
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,480
record in for this and maybe attach this

251
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,600
whole report into that CRM record.

252
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,840
And then you would also be able to click

253
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,560
on the link in this to get to that CRM

254
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,040
record that it just created, for example.

255
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,320
So really actually there's nothing that

256
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,800
cannot be rapidly

257
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,600
implemented into this tool, so we

258
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,360
can. Whether it's scheduling events

259
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,142
where you
