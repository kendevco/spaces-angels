Introduction to N8N Workflow with Veo Three
0:00
today what I'm going to show you is a
0:02
new NA10 workflow with VO3 that can
0:05
literally help you automate your ads
0:08
scene by scene So what you can see here
0:10
for example is an automation that we
0:12
created If I go in here for example and
0:14
I tell it the ads I want to create So
0:16
for example SEO agency
0:20
free SEO strategy session We'll hit send
0:24
in that Basically that's generated the
0:26
result now as you can see And then if we
Creating an Automated Ad
0:29
go over to our scene here we've actually
0:32
generated a workflow with A3 using this
0:35
exact process So for example let's play
0:37
this back leads and sales from Google
0:41
I'm here to help you with a free SEO
0:43
strategy session And then for example if
0:45
we play the end as well the link on this
0:47
ad and book your SEO strategy session
0:49
today Let's boost your online presence
0:52
together
0:54
So the way that this was generated is
0:56
using this workflow right here And
0:59
essentially step by step you can easily
1:01
generate a character location and script
1:03
using NA10 that you can then plug into
1:06
for example V3 or in this case I
1:08
actually used flow to generate a few
1:11
different ads like you can see using
1:13
this process right now This is actually
1:16
something that was inspired by another
1:18
video from Adrian viral AI marketing
1:21
I'll actually link to his video
1:25
awesome workflow that inspired this
1:27
right here And essentially what you can
1:30
do is you can go inside the chat and
1:33
you're going to say "Okay here's what I
1:35
do and then here's what I sell." So for
1:39
example for me SEO agency free SEO
1:42
strategy session is what I'm giving away
1:45
So if you want to use this step by step
1:47
essentially what you can do is you plug
1:49
in what you want and then it's going to
1:51
generate the scenes and the character
1:53
Okay So let's pull this up and I'll show
1:55
you how the prompts work So essentially
1:57
this is the ads copy generator You could
2:00
use this with something like foul as
Using Google Flow for Cost-Effective Video Generation
2:02
well What you can do with foul is you
2:04
can actually for example take your ideas
2:06
and then send them over to an API
2:08
request on foul.ai But the biggest issue
2:10
with that is it's going to cost you
2:11
quite a lot of money Whereas for example
2:12
you can actually do it a lot cheaper
2:14
just by taking the prompts and then
2:16
plugging them into something called
2:18
Google Flow Now Flow takes about $200
2:21
per month but if you're generating a lot
2:25
of videos at once then this is going to
2:27
be way cheaper per video right and you
2:29
can actually use something called Veo 3
2:32
fast to generate the prompts right this
2:35
is way cheaper So you select in your
2:37
settings here when you're using Google
2:39
flow on ultra ve 3 fast text video and
2:43
then you can generate the video that way
2:44
The other way that you can do this is
2:46
you can use foul that's typically $3 to
2:49
$6 per video which is cheaper than $200
2:51
per month but it depends how many videos
2:53
you generate it And then if we play this
2:55
back for example we've taken the example
2:59
prompt from NA10 and if we open this up
3:03
we'll go full screen on this get more
3:05
leads and sales from Google I'm here to
3:08
help you with a free SEO strategy
3:10
session So this is completely AI
3:12
generated with AO3 Want to get more the
3:14
audio the person everything else is
3:17
synced as well perfectly And then you
3:19
can actually download that and then plug
3:20
it into a video editor and just click
3:22
them all together Pretty simple and easy
3:25
So let's have a look at exactly how this
Generating Characters and Locations with Chat GPT
3:28
works So basically we plug in a chat
3:30
message So you just open up the chat You
3:32
tell it what you want Then from there
3:34
you're going to generate the character
3:36
prompt Right so you can see for all of
3:38
these generations we're using chat GBT
3:41
40 mini And inside the AI agent for the
3:44
character prompt we got this connected
3:46
to the chat trigger So for example I've
3:48
typed in SEO agency free SEO strategy
3:50
session over here And then inside the
3:54
settings for the system message Let me
3:56
pull this up and I'll show you some
3:58
examples
3:59
So you see here I've said you are a
4:02
worldclass Facebook ad strategist
4:05
trained to generate scroll stopping
4:07
characters specifically designed for
4:09
high converting ads right your job is to
4:11
do this example John 30 years old blah
4:14
blah blah make sure the character is
4:15
unique and different based on the
4:18
business now each time I run this will
4:19
actually generate different outputs
4:21
right so for example if I say okay pet
4:24
food business
4:26
selling dog food for example example
4:30
it's actually going to come up with
4:32
different responses based on that Right
4:34
so let's just refresh
4:36
the chat here And then you can get
4:39
different characters each time Right now
4:42
in terms of the location
4:45
you can see the prompts right here So
4:47
for example the prompt we say take the
4:50
company offer take the character in the
4:51
advert and then come up with a relevant
4:54
location for this process And then
4:57
finally for the script what we're doing
4:59
here is we're saying right in the first
5:01
line include a clickable link to labs
5:03
Google flow right so we can just quickly
5:05
copy and paste our prompts in and then
5:08
add the information below generate five
5:10
scenes take the information from the
5:12
chat the company etc and then just
5:14
generate the ad using that process
5:16
really simple and easy and then you know
5:19
you can easily generate whatever you
5:20
want right using this so let's test this
5:23
out again just going to in all the data
5:26
And now you can see for example it's
5:28
come up with Lola Hispanic blah blah
5:30
blah And what we can actually do is take
5:32
that scene So let's grab that We'll go
5:34
over to flow We'll generate a new video
5:38
We're going to use veo fast Make sure
5:40
you change your settings You actually
5:41
get audio from there And then you can
5:43
hit enter Right now if you actually want
5:45
to just use foul actually got an
5:47
automation for that But essentially you
5:49
would set up a HTTP request wait and
5:52
then grab the video from there Right is
5:54
you can add a HTTP request inside this
5:56
directly So as an example of that let me
6:01
take this and then what we can actually
6:04
do is we can take the prompt from the AI
6:07
agent and send that over to foul So let
6:09
me copy this for example Then we're
6:11
going to go over to automation If you
6:14
wanted to just automate this directly
6:17
you can grab that And then you can take
6:20
the output from the previous module and
6:23
plug this into the value section over
6:25
here And that will be the prompt Bear in
6:28
mind as well that you only want to
6:30
generate one prompt at a time So what
6:32
you can do with the script is you can
6:33
just say okay only generate one line
6:36
right only generate one scene for
6:38
example And that will give you like just
6:39
one scene to generate with the HTTP
6:42
request And then you would just wait a
6:45
minute get the information the URL back
6:48
from foul and then plug that in wherever
6:50
you want But pretty simple and easy to
6:52
automate using this process I like it
6:54
because it's a lot cheaper than using
6:56
foul which is way more expensive if you
6:58
don't have access to the bayast
7:00
automation And then also if we go to
7:04
float now we've got the new generation
7:06
So this is the new example of the prompt
7:08
we automated for our dog food example
7:11
Let's open this up full screen and see
7:12
what it's like Could be terrible because
7:14
I've just generated it live but let's
7:15
see what it's like Do you worry about
7:18
what's in your dog's food let's talk
7:20
about healthy options for your furry
7:22
friend That actually worked out
7:24
perfectly I can't believe it That was
7:27
live So yeah you can see exactly how it
7:29
works step by step Literally all we did
7:31
was we grab the scenes
7:35
inside the chat and then you can just
7:37
generate them step by step right if you
7:39
want to generate the second scene we can
7:41
just take that and then we can plug this
7:43
in One thing that I'm going to say and
7:45
just warn you about is the character
7:47
congruency is not great right so you
7:50
might find that like the character
7:51
congruency overall is not amazing but it
7:54
does the job So you know it's up to you
7:56
And I think some people worry about
7:59
what's in your dogs Why is that playing
8:01
yeah So let's play another one So we'll
8:03
grab scene two now And that will
8:05
generate the second scene as you can see
8:07
right here So for example this character
8:10
is not perfectly congruent
8:13
but it could work on an ad if you had
8:15
like B-roll and that sort of thing right
Automating Ads with HeyGen and Avatar Creation
8:17
the other option that you have for
8:18
automating ads is that you could take
8:20
exactly the same prompt and then you can
8:22
go over to Hey Gen as well So hey genen
8:24
is another one where you could create
8:26
avatar ads with this too So for example
8:28
if we take that then we could for
8:31
example go to home try Avatar 4 type in
8:35
your script and plug in the image of the
8:38
person that you want to use If you don't
8:40
have any images you can just use a
8:42
sample like you can see right here of
8:44
one of the other avatars that they've
8:46
got like this for example
8:49
You would remove the character
8:51
information and just insert the script
8:53
Right so you can take that delete this
8:56
everything else plug that in You can add
8:59
motion as well And then you can just
9:01
generate the avatar video But either way
9:03
you can easily automate ads using this
9:06
flow Super simple So if you want to get
