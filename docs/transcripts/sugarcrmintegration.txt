Analyze this - this is what we want:

0:00
what if your sweet CM system would be
0:03
integrated in your marketing automation
0:06
in no automation into all your other
0:09
business systems and use AI in order to
0:13
help you with tasks with building your
0:15
automations and integrations inside your
0:18
business and streamline everything let's
0:20
find out so I'm very much excited about
0:24
this one here so I've built up a little
0:26
bit of a demo a tech stack a marketing
0:28
tech stack and I want to show and share
0:31
this with you let's first look into the
0:34
overall system and what we've got here
0:36
so of course our sweetm system and
0:41
additionally we've got a Mortic
0:43
installation here as well and we've got
0:47
an automation installation as well and
0:50
this one helps to automate processes to
0:53
integrate AI to um do and execute
0:57
workflows later on for us and
0:58
additionally to integrate Mortic with
1:02
the CRM itself don't worry about the
1:04
details here we're going to all build
1:07
this up in in the future videos
1:10
additionally there's not much data at
1:13
the moment so if I go back here there
1:15
are not many contacts but a couple of
1:17
test contacts and those two forms and
1:20
those two forms are this one here which
1:22
is basically a yeah the first level and
1:25
second level form for maybe here
1:27
something like a newsletter and here
1:29
webinar or similar let's start with it
1:33
so first of all here first name is not
1:36
required second name is or last name is
1:38
required and therefore we've got this
1:41
and let me first double check my CRM
1:44
system and as you can see there are zero
1:46
leads at the moment so I want to change
1:49
this so I want to have this one here
1:52
going from our Mortic form of course
1:55
that doesn't look very good now and you
1:57
will have to integrate this in your own
1:59
website and design and everything but
2:01
going from this Mortic form into the
2:04
sweet CM system and I switched this here
2:07
to testing so you can see what's
2:09
happening
2:09
here and yeah just standard Mortic
2:13
functionality nothing special and it
2:15
already triggered this one here and it
2:18
started to transfer and I'm going to
2:21
update the CM system now it created a
2:24
lead for us inside the CRM system very
2:27
nice let's quickly go through what
2:30
happens here so the amazing thing is
2:33
compared to the plugin that you have to
2:36
a little bit code and and make it work
2:39
somehow if you use N8N here check out
2:43
those triggers so of course you need to
2:44
set up your mortic account and then it
2:46
will listen for all those triggers here
2:49
and whenever anything happens you can
2:53
react to this in your N8N and you can
2:57
build up really powerful marketing
3:00
automation marketing systems with this
3:02
one here and what happens with rest so
3:05
we're going to um connect to the CRM
3:07
setting some variables then we're going
3:09
to search for the contact if we found it
3:12
then we do something with a contact if
3:14
not then we going to the lead search for
3:16
it if we found it we're going to go do
3:19
something with a lead and if not we're
3:21
going to create a lead and this is what
3:22
just happened so it didn't find any
3:25
existing lead therefore it created it so
3:27
what you see here is a system for
3:30
avoiding duplicates and you will see
3:32
this in further videos as well because
3:35
duplicates are just have a headache
3:37
inside your CRM system in sales in
3:40
marketing in all ways so therefore try
3:42
to avoid it and this is how you can
3:44
avoid duplicates so let's go into our CM
3:47
system and see what happens here yeah
3:51
just what I entered so my last name my
3:53
email address nothing special so far but
3:55
as I mentioned there are couple of
3:57
customizations
3:59
you see we've got touch points here
4:02
which is a custom module nothing with
4:05
code all while the studio and module
4:07
builder and so on so
4:10
here our N8N just created this touch
4:14
point for us that means we will be
4:17
building up a history of touch points
4:20
that a lead or a customer went through
4:23
on the journey to become our yeah valued
4:27
long-term customer with us so you can
4:30
see this really amazing so there was the
4:32
standard web form which has been filled
4:35
out the touch point category could now
4:38
be web form could be SMS message could
4:40
be emails could be anything that you
4:42
imagine here and there is the yeah form
4:46
preview as well or if you will like the
4:49
URL where it comes from very nice very
4:51
neat that worked smoothly but let's see
4:55
whether the duplicate works as well so
4:57
let's assume it was a newsletter so you
5:01
would add like two three newsletters and
5:03
sooner or later you would offer a
5:04
webinar and there for the webinar you
5:07
want to have some more data and the data
5:09
can be entered in the registration form
5:12
for the webinar
5:14
so then this person would add all the
5:17
details here
5:21
um and you make them required because
5:24
now it's webinar therefore you can get
5:26
or retrieve more data and what I'm going
5:28
to do now again you can just activate it
5:31
here as well and it would work in the
5:33
background but I always like to see this
5:35
here in demos that really something is
5:37
working so see you in the webinar here
5:39
it already took care and as you can see
5:42
the difference now is before It created
5:44
a lead now it found a lead and it did
5:47
something it updated the lead and it
5:48
created a touch point as well let's see
5:51
whether this is true so I'm going back
5:54
to my lead refreshing it and now as you
5:58
can see we've got more data about the
6:00
lead we've got the first name finally
6:02
we've got the account name okay for
6:04
freelancers it might be a bit difficult
6:06
but we've got the website here which is
6:09
really helpful because you can find more
6:11
out about your your lead who is
6:13
participating in your webinar now and
6:16
additionally maybe we should sort this
6:19
by time and then you can see the webinar
6:22
form has been filled as well touchoint
6:25
category is now not the standard web
6:27
form but it is a webinar because that's
6:29
the interaction which happened next so
6:31
as I said you can can create those here
6:35
whatever you see fit and then add SMS
6:37
emails or snail mail or whatever you you
6:41
use for your marketing
6:43
campaigns so but there is more so you
6:46
can see website details title and
6:49
heading one and I've mentioned before
6:52
that we're using AI as well to help us
6:55
with our task that I just don't want to
6:58
do as like in sales marketing you've got
7:00
so many tasks why do you need to take
7:02
care of of data enrichment and the
7:05
answer is you should not you should have
7:07
some AI doing this for you and how does
7:09
this work so of course there are
7:12
different ways on how you can integrate
7:14
automate and everything you don't even
7:16
have to create those tasks but for this
7:19
demo here I'd like to show it i would
7:22
now create a task for this lead here and
7:25
I would simply say get website details
7:29
and priority doesn't matter the only
7:32
thing that matters is it's related to
7:34
our lead here yes not started as well
7:37
but I don't want to assign it to user i
7:40
want to assign it to there is an AI user
7:45
the AI assistant and this is who I want
7:47
to assign it to so I save this
7:51
now and what happens now is this one is
7:54
getting triggered so this one at the
7:56
moment it checks all I think 15 seconds
7:58
for new task and then it would work this
8:01
one here so and I've got this one active
8:03
so you can check this via the executions
8:06
what happened when and if there are new
8:08
task whether they have been executed
8:11
successfully so therefore let's go into
8:16
here and see what actually happened so
8:18
we're going back into our
8:19
lead and you see this one has been
8:23
filled up for me very interesting so
8:27
let's think quickly about it so before
8:30
this was empty I didn't want to do the
8:32
data enrichment but I've created a task
8:35
which is the get website leads and
8:38
someone the AI assistant has completed
8:41
this task already and stored the
8:43
information here so now I see something
8:46
okay this bastion hammer here it's all
8:48
about CRM marketing automation and
8:50
digital to commerce okay that's correct
8:52
and now it got the German version here
8:55
but it's still correct so it retrieved
8:57
the H1 details because arguably this is
9:01
the most important information on
9:03
everybody's website or or front page
9:06
website so therefore that looks really
9:08
really
9:09
good the only thing which I find a bit
9:12
thin is the information about the lead
9:15
itself so what can I do here i could
9:18
actually create yet another task and
9:20
this task I would simply call it get
9:23
lead details and again the rest would be
9:27
totally the same and I just want to
9:29
assign it to my AI user here this one
9:34
save it again and now we just have to
9:37
wait and again you have to see how you
9:40
integrate this in your CRM system and
9:43
daily processes you don't have to go
9:45
through um AI or whatever you can have
9:47
all those workflows that I've built now
9:49
separately which are being triggered by
9:52
tasks automatically into your yeah when
9:56
lead comes into your system it can just
9:58
do everything at the same time again so
10:01
get lead details has been completed by
10:04
our AI assistant and what happened here
10:08
it found Yeah well so now it checked a
10:12
third-party API which scrapes data from
10:15
from the web and trying to get data from
10:17
me and it found my job title which is
10:20
not completely correct but it found my
10:23
LinkedIn link so therefore that's very
10:26
good so I can simply click on LinkedIn
10:28
and I'm already at the leads LinkedIn
10:31
profile very nice plus it added the
10:34
address for me very neat as well so I
10:38
don't have to do data enrichment much i
10:41
can just rely on third party APIs to to
10:45
do that for me very well so that already
10:49
looks quite amazing so this data
10:52
enrichment has been taken care of by an
10:56
AI assistant or by like an N8N
10:59
automation in the background and the
11:01
amazing thing about this is additionally
11:03
there was no custom development code
11:06
updating uploading or whatever checking
11:09
into GitHub it's just all here inside my
11:12
notmation
11:14
and then um if you want to keep it local
11:20
that works as well so you can even
11:22
create tasks let's me let me try to get
11:25
this done so if we have something like
11:30
um how can AI help with CRM work and
11:36
then we would do the same thing and here
11:39
I've got something like a fork in the
11:42
logic and every time I don't have
11:44
something like the predefined get lead
11:46
information or whatever then it would
11:50
simply go into other and other would be
11:54
like an AI agent and as you can see it's
11:56
all llama here the local chat model and
11:59
it's running actually on my local laptop
12:02
here whilst recording videos and it's
12:05
the three billion model and it it still
12:09
works so let's go back into the CRM
12:11
system and see what happened with this
12:13
task so every time the AI can't figure
12:17
out what to do with the task it would
12:20
just take it so this takes a little bit
12:22
longer because it has to go back and
12:24
forth with the model itself and then it
12:28
would just answer inside the description
12:32
so let's quickly wait for it and refresh
12:35
the page again
12:39
and as you can see this has been
12:42
generated locally on my small laptop
12:46
here there's no dedicated GPU whatever
12:49
so this is all happening without sending
12:52
any data to any data centers or whatever
12:55
so this is really powerful and of course
12:57
you can do way more and um yeah how to
13:02
find out what else can be done first of
13:05
all let me know your ideas your
13:07
requirements what else could be done
13:09
here and additionally check out the next
13:12
videos stay tuned for the next videos
13:15
because I'm going to build up this
13:17
system even more develop some more stuff
13:20
i've got some ideas with sentiment
13:22
analysis of of things and yeah more data
13:27
enrichment and automation processes in
13:30
the background for you whilst you're
13:32
working with your sweet CMs so thank you
13:35
very much for checking this one out i
13:37
hope you're as excited as me about this
13:40
and yeah stay tuned we'll see each other
13:43
in the next video see you then bye
