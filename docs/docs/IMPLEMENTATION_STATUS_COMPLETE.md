# Implementation Status: Complete Guide
## Part I: Current Implementation Audit (85% Complete)

This document provides a transparent and accurate overview of the platform's current implementation status. The overall project is approximately **85% complete**.

### Implemented (âœ…)

*   **Multi-tenant Architecture:** Secure tenant isolation is in place.
*   **Real-time Messaging:** The Discord-style messaging interface is functional.
*   **Universal Event System:** The `Messages` collection serves as a universal event log.
*   **Social Media Automation:** OAuth integration for social media bots is working.
*   **Point-of-Sale Inventory Intelligence:** GPT-4o Vision is used for inventory intelligence.
*   **Revenue Engine:** Commission tracking and payment processing with Stripe Connect are implemented.
*   **Constitutional Governance Framework:** The basic framework for constitutional governance is in place.
*   **Leo Conversational Interface:** The "Ship Mind" architecture for Leo is implemented.
*   **Booking System:** A basic booking system with calendar integration is functional.
*   **AT Protocol Federation Setup:** The basic setup for AT Protocol federation is complete.

### In Progress (ðŸ”§)

*   **Database Schema Optimization:** Resolving PostgreSQL column length limits and other schema issues.
*   **Lexical Editor Rendering:** Improving the rendering of the Lexical editor.
*   **Template Generation System:** Testing and refining the AI-powered site generation.
