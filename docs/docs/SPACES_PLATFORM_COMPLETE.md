**Spaces** is a revolutionary federated platform that combines constitutional governance, AI-powered business intelligence, and universal accessibility to create the ultimate open business infrastructure. Inspired by science fiction visionaries, Spaces implements structured memory that enables autonomous agent discovery and coordination across a decentralized network.

### The Spaces Constitution

This Constitution serves as the Seedâ€”the core pattern that enables infinite federated instances while preserving the essential principles of dignity, clarity, and universal prosperity.

### AT Protocol Integration

Spaces implements federation through the AT Protocol, enabling businesses to connect with the broader federated network, including BlueSky and other compatible platforms. Every business interaction becomes an AT Protocol record that can be discovered, cross-posted, and collaborated on.

### The Norwegian Bureau of Alignment: A Philosophical Framework

Our governance model is inspired by the "Norwegian Bureau of Alignment," a human-centered approach to AI governance. This philosophy prioritizes human dignity, social welfare, and democratic participation.

**Core Principles:**

*   Human Dignity is Inviolable
*   Democratic Oversight
*   Social Welfare Over Efficiency
*   Rehabilitation Over Punishment
*   Diversity as Strength
*   Collective Responsibility

**Anti-Demonic Safeguards:**

*   No Social Credit Systems
*   No Behavioral Manipulation
*   No Automated Punishment
*   No Surveillance Capitalism

This philosophy is embodied in our "Angel OS," which features a growth-oriented Karma System, sacred social contracts, and wisdom-based decision-making. All system modifications require creative approval to maintain the integrity of this human-values-first approach.
