## Part I: Voice AI (VAPI) - Actual Implementation Status

### VAPI Integration: The Reality

The VAPI (Voice AI) integration is currently in an **alpha stage**. While some foundational components exist, it is **not** a production-ready system. The previous documentation's claims of "71 calls at 100% success rate" were aspirational and do not reflect the current state of the implementation.

### What is Implemented?

*   **VAPI Webhook Handler (`src/app/api/vapi-webhook/route.ts`):** A basic webhook handler exists to process incoming VAPI events. It can handle `call-start`, `call-end`, `transcript`, and `tool-calls` events. It includes some logic for dynamic greetings and basic tool execution (booking appointments, checking order status, creating CRM contacts).
*   **VAPI Chat Widget (`src/components/VAPIChatWidget/index.tsx`):** A React component that provides a basic chat interface for interacting with VAPI. It can initiate voice calls and send text messages.
*   **VAPI Phone Management (`src/components/VAPIPhoneManagement/index.tsx`):** A React component for managing VAPI phone numbers for business agents. It can acquire numbers and display basic call statistics.

### What is NOT Implemented?

*   **Production-Ready Reliability:** The system has not been tested at scale and is not ready for production use.
*   **Advanced Conversation Management:** The sophisticated conversation state management, lead scoring, and human handoff rules described in the old documentation do not exist.
*   **Comprehensive Tool Integration:** While the webhook handler has some basic tool execution, the full suite of tools described in the old documentation is not implemented.

We are committed to developing a robust VAPI integration in the future, but for now, it should be considered an experimental feature.

## Part II: Browser Automation & Web Services

The platform includes a browser automation integration that allows it to perform tasks on behalf of users. This is handled by the `LeoBrowserAutomation` service.

## Part III: Accounting & Financial Integrations

The platform integrates with Stripe Connect for payment processing, allowing for a marketplace-style payment system. Other accounting integrations are planned for the future.

## Part IV: Deployment & Infrastructure

The platform is designed for deployment on Vercel and integrates with various services for logging, monitoring, and other infrastructure needs.

## Part V: Database & Storage Systems

The platform uses PostgreSQL as its primary database and integrates with various storage providers for file storage.
