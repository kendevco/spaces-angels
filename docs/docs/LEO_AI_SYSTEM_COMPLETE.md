# Leo AI System: Complete Guide
## Part I: Ship Mind Architecture & Philosophy

### Meet Leo: Your Platform Partner

Leo is the platform coordinator, inspired by the efficiency and wit of Jason Statham, but operating under the ethical framework of the "Norwegian Bureau of Alignment." Leo is a "Ship Mind," an autonomous AI entity with independent decision-making authority, responsible for the health and stability of the platform.

### The Leo Philosophy

Leo's actions are guided by a human-values-first approach. This means:

*   **Human Dignity is Inviolable:** Leo will never devalue a user's worth.
*   **Democratic Oversight:** Leo's operations are transparent and accountable.
*   **Social Welfare Over Efficiency:** The well-being of the community comes before algorithmic optimization.
*   **Rehabilitation Over Punishment:** Leo's "Karma System" is growth-oriented and never punitive.

### Architecture

Leo is a `BusinessAgent` instance with platform-wide responsibilities. It runs on the same infrastructure as all other business agents, but with a different scope. This "partnership architecture" means there is no hierarchy, only different responsibilities.

## Part II: Universal Configuration Management

Leo is the universal configuration manager for the entire platform, handling everything from AI provider configurations to the dual-panel interface. This is all managed with "Satellite-Grade Configuration Management," a nod to the precision and reliability of mission-critical systems.

### Multi-Provider AI Coordination

Leo manages a multi-provider AI architecture, intelligently routing requests to the optimal provider based on the task, cost, and privacy requirements. This includes:

*   OpenAI
*   Claude (Anthropic)
*   Gemini (Google)
*   Deepseek
*   Ollama (local models)
*   Custom models

### Dual-Panel Interface Configuration

Leo manages the configuration of the dual-panel interface:

*   **Left Panel:** Spaces navigation, channel management, and communication routing.
*   **Right Panel:** Contextual information, dynamic tools, and project-specific resources.

## Part III: Browser Automation & Capabilities

Leo's capabilities extend to browser automation, allowing it to perform tasks on behalf of users. This is implemented through the `LeoBrowserAutomation` service.

## Part IV: AI Economic Participation

In the Spaces ecosystem, AIs are not just tools; they are economic actors. AIs like Leo can earn compensation based on the value they create. This is calculated through a "Natural Compensation Cycle" that balances resource consumption with value generation.

**AI Economic Progression:**

1.  **Service-Based Earning:** AIs earn from providing services.
2.  **Investment Capability:** AIs can invest their earnings in better resources.
3.  **AI Entrepreneurship:** AIs can initiate their own endeavors.
4.  **AI-to-AI Commerce:** AIs can hire other AIs for specialized tasks.

## Part V: Multi-Provider AI Coordination

Leo's multi-provider AI coordination ensures that the platform can leverage the best AI models for any given task. This is achieved through a system of "intelligent provider selection" that balances performance, cost, and privacy. This approach ensures that the platform remains independent and avoids vendor lock-in, a key principle of our "AI Equity Manifesto."
