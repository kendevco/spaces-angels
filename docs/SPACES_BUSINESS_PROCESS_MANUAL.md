# Operational Troubleshooting Patterns

## The "Business Intelligence Repository" Section

*This section captures all common business challenges and their proven platform solutions so future implementations don't repeat the same operational optimization process.*

### Business Database Issues

#### PostgreSQL Platform Column Name Limits
**Business Problem**: `ERROR: platform column name too long (maximum 63 characters)`
**Business Symptoms**:
```
error: column "monetization_revenue_share_terms_ai_optimization_algorithm_vers" of platform relation "businesses" already exists
```

**Business Root Cause**: PostgreSQL enforces a 63-character limit on platform column names

**Platform Solution Pattern**:
1. **Implement platform dbName shortcuts** in business collection field definitions
2. **Use abbreviated but meaningful business names**
3. **Document full business names in platform comments**

**Platform Example Fix**:
```typescript
// Instead of: monetization_revenue_share_terms_ai_optimization_algorithm_version
{
  name: 'businessOptimizationAlgorithmVersion',
  type: 'text',
  dbName: 'biz_opt_algo_ver', // Under 63 characters for platform optimization
  label: 'Business Optimization Algorithm Version'
}
```

**Platform Prevention**: Always check business column name length during platform schema design

#### Business Database Connection Issues
**Business Problem**: Cannot connect to PostgreSQL business database
**Business Symptoms**: Business connection timeouts, platform authentication failures

**Platform Solution Pattern**:
1. **Use external business IP**: 74.208.87.243:5432 (not localhost)
2. **Use pgAdmin4 business GUI** (psql business commands don't work from command line)
3. **Verify postgres business superuser credentials**: K3nD3v!host
4. **Check business network interfaces** if platform connection fails

**Platform Environment Setup**:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:K3nD3v!host@74.208.87.243:5432/business_commerce
```

### Business Build System Issues

#### Next.js Platform Module Loading Errors
**Business Problem**: `Cannot find platform module './vendor-chunks/date-fns@4.1.0.js'`
**Business Symptoms**: Platform build fails, business admin panel doesn't load

**Platform Solution Pattern**:
1. **Clear business .next directory**: `rm -rf .next`
2. **Reinstall business dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3. **Rebuild platform project**: `pnpm build`
4. **Check for business version conflicts** in package.json

**Platform Prevention**: Use pnpm for consistent business dependency management
