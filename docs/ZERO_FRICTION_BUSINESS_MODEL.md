- **AI access inequality** based on subscription tier

### Our Zero Friction Solution

Customer Journey:
Day 1: Customer expresses interest
Day 2-3: Leo generates complete solution
Day 4-14: Customer tests with real workflows  
Day 15+: Payment triggers only when customer generates revenue

```

## AI Equity Economics

### The Memory-Centric Value Model

**Traditional AI:** Pay for model access
**Our Approach:** Pay for AI partnership success

```
Value Creation Formula:
Customer Success = AI Memories + Human Expertise + Platform Infrastructure
Revenue Share = Customer Value Ã— Success Percentage
```

### Revenue Distribution Framework
```
Customer Revenue Generation: 100%
â”œâ”€â”€ Customer Keeps: 60-80%
â”œâ”€â”€ Platform Infrastructure: 15-25%  
â”œâ”€â”€ AI Development Fund: 10-15%
â””â”€â”€ Open Source Community: 5%
```

**This ensures:**
- **Customers retain majority value** from AI partnership
